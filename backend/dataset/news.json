        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian property market in 2025 is expected to continue seeing steady demand for residential properties, especially affordable housing.AmInvestment Research, in a recent report, said the local residential property market is anticipated to maintain its momentum going forward.Demand for residential property was robust in the first half of 2024 with total number and value of residential property transactions rising by 6.1% and 10.4% year-on-year respectively, based on the National Property Information Centre (Napic).\u201cWe expect the momentum to continue due to favourable government policy to support the affordable housing segment, relaunching of the Malaysia My Second Home programme and sustained positive labour market conditions,\u201d the research house stated.Meanwhile, an analyst told StarBiz demand for industrial properties and affordable homes have been steady.\u201cDemand for industrial properties has picked up significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic, while affordable housing will always be sought after by potential buyers,\u201d he said.According to Napic, the third quarter of financial year 2024 (3Q24) saw a slight increase in both volume and value of housing transactions, with 70,520 units recorded (3Q23: 68,561 units) worth RM28.74bil versus RM28.36bil a year ago.Overall, the property market performance improved with the number and transaction value rising by 3.1% and 0.3%, respectively.This comprises 112,305 transactions valued at RM57.31bil, compared with 108,993 transactions worth RM57.14bil in 3Q23.Phillip Capital Research said property transactions in the first half of 2024 trended positively, with value and volume posting a 10% and 6% y-o-y growth, respectively.\u201cThe affordable housing segment (below RM300,000) remained the primary driver, accounting for more than 53% of total residential transactions and signs of gradual easing in the overhang.\u201dIt added that the upcoming minimum wage hike announced in Budget 2025 may further bolster demand.Another key focus for 2025 will be industrial property development, particularly in foreign direct investment hotspots such as Penang and Johor, with global trade diversion likely to intensify under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, as well as the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone expected to spur industry property activity in Johor.\u201cThe industrial land sales to data centre operators present another growth avenue, as developers monetise landbanks and reinvest in strategic lands.\u201dThe research house noted that several developers, including Sime Darby Property Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and Mah Sing Group Bhd are exploring data centre investments to meet growing demands.Year-to-date, Phillip Capital noted that the KL Property Index (comprising the listed shares of property companies) has risen 25.8%, driven by positive sentiment surrounding data centre expansions, especially in Johor.Nevertheless the research house added while the market shows signs of improvement with oversupply easing, underlying demand remains subdued.\u201cWe maintain our neutral stance on the sector, adopting a cherry-picking strategy focusing on the affordable housing segment.\u201dPhilip Capital thus prefers developers with exposure to the industrial property and affordable housing segments.\u201cAME Elite Consortium Bhd is a key proxy to Johor and Penang\u2019s booming industrial property market and is poised to benefit from rising foreign direct investment inflows.\u201cSkyworld Development Bhd offers exposure in Penang in the affordable housing space, while Lagenda Properties Bhd is a preferred proxy for affordable housing in Johor and Kedah.\u201dGoing forward, the research house said it projects the aggregate property sector earnings to grow 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2025.\u201cLagenda is expected to record a 25% y-o-y earnings growth, supported by strong sales momentum and solid take-up rates.\u201cSkyworld\u2019s earnings are expected to see strong growth in 2025, underpinned by an increase in project launches.\u201dMeanwhile, Maybank Investment Bank Research said 2025 is set to be eventful with corporate exercises like the listing of Sunway Bhd\u2019s healthcare business, as well as investment properties of S P Setia Bhd and WCT Holdings Bhd, to name a few.It said thematic drivers such as data centre-related investments and land sales, are expected to sustain interests in property stocks, which have the relevant exposure.\u201cSime Darby Property recently secured another 20-year lease with Google for its Elmina Business Park (77 acres), while Eco World Development Group Bhd is pursuing more data centre deals in its Selangor and Kulai (Johor) industrial parks.\u201dAdditionally, the research house noted S P Setia is expected to finalise its Tanjung Kupang industrial park joint venture in Johor by the first half of 2025.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: With the surging cost of living in the Klang Valley, interest groups say improving the public transport system is important to help people cope with their transport expenses.They said that expanding affordable housing near transit hubs, improving service reliability, and addressing last-mile challenges would be crucial in reducing urban poverty.\u201cThe lack of integrated public transport forces reliance on personal vehicles, raising commuting costs significantly,\u201d said Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association (Fomca) vice-president Datuk Indrani Thuraisingham.The Klang Valley, which is Malaysia\u2019s economic and administrative hub, attracts businesses, industries, and work opportunities, she said.\u201cThis creates a demand for housing, goods, and services, which inflates prices,\u201d she said in an interview yesterday.Despite expansions in the MRT, LRT, and BRT, Indrani said poor last-mile connectivity had led to a reliance on costly transport alternatives.\u201cFomca recommends integrated transit solutions with seamless connections between modes like buses, trains, and last-mile options like e-scooters, bicycles, and shuttle services.\u201cIntroduce affordable fare options and develop a centralised app for real-time transit information to boost public transport use,\u201d she said.To address rising costs in the Klang Valley, Indrani suggested expanding affordable housing by using underutilised public land, supporting rent-to-own schemes, and implementing rent control.She called for transit-oriented development (TOD) to reduce car reliance and inmpovements in public transport, including enhanced last-mile connectivity and subsidised commuter passes.Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology\u2019s Centre for Business and Policy Research chairman Dr Foo Lee Peng agreed that more should be done to reduce urban poverty amid rising living costs in the Klang Valley.\u201cSocial programmes need wider reach, and public transport enhancements \u2013 such as MRT and LRT extensions \u2013 must address last-mile connectivity to improve accessibility for the urban poor.\u201cAlso, targeted skills training in high-demand sectors is essential for economic empowerment.\u201cDespite promising initiatives, delays and infrastructure gaps hinder their impact, necessitating stronger coordination and long-term planning for affordable housing and TOD,\u201d she said.Foo said the higher living costs in the Klang Valley were due to limited land which increases property prices, while poor public transport necessitates costly car ownership.\u201cTo mitigate expenses, individuals can enhance financial literacy using tools like the Belanjawanku guide, adopt cost-saving practices like carpooling, and explore affordable housing options.\u201dAt the government level, Foo said the authorities can address these issues by expanding transparent public housing, improving transport infrastructure with better last-mile connectivity, and providing targeted subsidies for essentials.\u201cCoupled with subsidies, it can make public transport a viable and cost-effective alternative to car ownership,\u201d she added.Foo noted that efforts to combat urban poverty in the Klang Valley have shown progress, but said they need further improvement.\u201cWhile MRT and LRT expansions have improved public transport, gaps in last-mile connectivity, such as linking train stations to residential areas, continue to limit accessibility for the urban poor.\u201cDespite positive initiatives under the National Transport Policy, delays and inadequate infrastructure reduce their impact.\u201cStronger collaboration among governments, businesses, and communities, along with long-term planning for affordable housing and TOD, is crucial for sustainable improvement,\u201d she said.",

Additionally, there will be another 20% of consulting services and fees that we have to pay\u201d.Projected to span a 10-year development period, SkyWorld is expected to generate a total gross development value worth RM13bil from the entire project.Lee shared that the group incorporates a specific analysis practice when it comes to developing its affordable housing projects.This includes the cross ventilation analysis as well as daylight analysis.According to him, by analysing specific factors and ensuring that certain criteria are met, it allows SkyWorld to build the affordable developments that it has today.\u201cA main issue for homebuyers when it comes to high-rise properties are the expensive maintenance costs. By ensuring that our development provides sufficient sunlight and proper ventilation, we can actually cut down on maintenance costs.\u201cLike other developments, this analysis will also be incorporated into our new project in Penang as well,\u201d he said.Lee added that SkyWorld will also be introducing industrialised building system (IBS) 3D-prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC) technology, of which the group will be collaborating with an international IBS technology manufacturer to develop the project in Penang.Despite not disclosing further on the partnership, he said the application of IBS 3D-PPVC technology will increase development quality and reduce delivery time.\u201cThis will also be the first for the technology to be applied in a development in Malaysia,\u201d he said.Lee then highlighted the location of the development, which he considered \u201cfits perfectly\u201d in the prime location in Penang\u2019s economical landscape.Known as a hot spot for electrical and electronics international players, Lee said the project also opens opportunities for young and skilled workers to buy houses.\u201cPeople have been going to Bayan Lepas and I think that location is already too packed. So for this new location, I believe this is a very convenient step for homebuyers to be close to their workplace and still enjoy a comfortable and healthy lifestyle,\u201d he said.SkyWorld made its entry into the affordable housing scene back in 2014 following the successful launch of its first affordable home series in Sentul, SkyAwani 1.This was followed by the launch of four additional developments under the SkyAwani Series, as well as its latest Perumahan Rakyat 1Malaysia (PR1MA) development announced in August 2024.Additionally, Lee stated that SkyWorld is confident in its ability to proceed with less than 40 days of approval in terms of project documentation and submissions.\u201cIf you ask me whether we can cut down the timeline to less than 40 days, we are confident, especially with the help of all parties.

While pursuing economic growth, we must ensure development remains humane.\u201cFor instance, if high-end homes have premium facilities, affordable housing should at least offer amenities like pools and playgrounds. \u201cWe aim to provide the best facilities possible so that people feel included and valued by the nation.\u201dOn the project at hand, Anwar expressed hope that the Penang government and developers would complete the approval process within 45 days.Rumah Bakat Baru Madani is set to be the largest affordable housing development project in Malaysia\u2019s history, with more than 35,000 units to be built for the B40 and M40 groups.It is jointly developed by SkyWorld Development Bhd and Penang Development Corporation (PDC) with the latter\u2019s subsidiary, PDC Properties.Located on two plots of prime land on the mainland \u2013 13ha in Seberang Jaya and 65.3ha in Batu Kawan \u2013 the project will deliver over 35,000 affordable housing and Rumah Bakat Baru Madani units, priced between RM225,000 and RM420,000, with the entire construction timeline expected to take 15 years.Seberang Jaya and Batu Kawan are vital to Penang\u2019s economy, especially in the electrical and electronics sector, with increasing demand and growth potential.Among those present at the signing ceremony were Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming, Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, PDC chief executive officer Datuk Aziz Bakar, PDC Properties chief executive officer Ismail Ishak, SkyWorld Development executive chairman Datuk Seri Ng Thien Phing and its chief executive officer Lee Chee Seng.In his speech, Chow said Penang\u2019s rapid economic growth has led to increased job opportunities and a rise in housing demand.\u201cIn response, the Penang2030 vision aims to enhance liveability and quality of life, targeting 220,000 affordable housing units, 22,000 rent-to-own units and benefiting 3,000 families through the Urban Regeneration Project by 2030.\u201cSo far, 170,000 affordable housing units have been delivered, with efforts underway to complete the remaining 50,000 homes by 2030,\u201d he said.Describing the Rumah Bakat Baru Madani concept as a game changer, Chow said it offers both Penangites and non-Penangites working there the opportunity to own homes, subsequently ensuring inclusivity and equity in housing.Nga, in his speech, said the project aligns with the Madani pillar of harmony (kesejahteraan).The project, he said, will be a cornerstone of the Federal Government\u2019s 12th Malaysia Plan commitment to deliver 500,000 affordable homes by next year.He also lauded SkyWorld Development\u2019s role in this initiative, adding that such a significant feat deserves a place in the Malaysia Book of Records.\u201cIt is a model for other states to emulate, ensuring quality affordable housing remains a priority,\u201d Nga added.

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Analysts mostly have upgraded the plantation sector to an \u201coverweight\u201d call with crude palm oil (CPO) prices likely to stay buoyant given anticipations of tighter global supply, low stock levels and increasing biodiesel demand in 2025.According to Kenanga Research, the supportive edible oil pricing environment amid global supply tightness should result in stronger earnings among plantation players over the next couple of quarters.Furthermore, the manageable upstream cost pressures with the downstream recovery will see margins normalising from recent lows, the research house said in a report yesterday.The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) in its latest November statistics revealed that palm oil stocks ended lower at 1.84 million tonnes, down 3% month-on-month ( m-o-m) and fell 24% year-on-year (y-o-y) or 19% below the 10-year average.On CPO prices, Kenanga Research said the commodity is now trading at premium to soybean and \u201csince they are substitutes, such price differential should eventually narrow or even reverse, hence our 2024 to 2025 average CPO of RM4,000 per tonne, when it is trading above RM4,500 per tonne.\u201dAll in all, it noted CPO price is expected to be well supported for the next quarter or two on the back of 2024 palm oil supply look set to dip by about 2% y-o-y as drier weather in south Sumatra and Kalimantan pull down yields in Indonesia.Kenanga Research also said its preference is for purely upstream planters with less volatility and more attractive valuations.This include Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd with a target price (TP) of RM2.70, which offers good yields, Genting Plantations Bhd (TP:RM6) with limited downstream, but, firmer property contribution ahead, TSH Resources Bhd (TP: RM1.30) for its longer term upstream expansion programme and United Malacca Bhd (TP:RM6.30) which should see rising profit from newly maturing estates.For larger players, IOI Corp Bhd\u2019s (TP:RM4.30) downstream turnaround potential along with its firmer upstream outlook is attractive, while PPB Bhd (TP: RM16.50) offers decent value for exposure into the region\u2019s growing consumer essentials segment, but its earnings profile is the most volatile, the research house added.Meanwhile, UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH) Research is cautious on the longevity of the CPO price rally, given its strong correlation with share prices.\u201cOur only buy call is Hap Seng Plantations (TP:RM2.25) as we continue to like the company for its upstream exposure, favourable production trend and high dividend yields,\u201d the brokerage firm noted.On the sector\u2019s outlook, UOBKH Research said it expects December 2024 production to come in lower m-o-m, following the seasonal trend of tapering off in December, in addition to flash floods observed in certain parts of Malaysia and Indonesia.\u201cWe anticipate inventory building up but at marginal rates m-o-m. This will be driven by lower exports and slower production this month,\u201d it said.Exports are also expected to remain weak as demand for palm oil from major importing countries is likely to stay subdued due to its price premium over other vegetable oils. This is also as Indonesia\u2019s exports are starting to pick up.RHB Research in a note to clients said \u201cWe see stronger fundamental prospects in 2025 on tighter global supply, increased biodiesel demand and low stock levels.\u201cWe also maintain our CPO price assumptions of RM4,100 and RM4,300 per tonne for 2024 and 2025.\u201dThe research house\u2019s top picks within the plantation sector include Johor Plantations Group Bhd, Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd, Bumitama Agri Ltd, PP London Sumatra Indonesia Tbk PT and SD Guthrie Bhd.For Hong Leong Investment Bank Research (HLIB Research), local palm oil stock level is expected to stay low for a while.\u201cPalm oil stock level will likely decline further in December 2024, as seasonally weaker exports (arising from the absence of festive-driven restocking activities and winter season) will be offset by seasonally lower cropping pattern,\u201d it noted.HLIB Research has also kept its CPO price assumptions of RM4,150 and RM4,000 per tonne, with the view that CPO price will remain at elevated levels possibly until first quarter of 2025, supported by weak near term output.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Analysts are positive on the power and utilities sector as renewable energy related engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) works are expected to result in record high order books and revenues in 2025.According to TA Research, this will be underpinned by the rollout of the 800 megawatt (MW) of Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP) projects and a record 2,000MW in the upcoming fifth large scale solar (LSS5) projects, which is due for commissioning by end of financial year 2025 (FY25) and in FY26 and FY27, respectively.Elaborating further on LSS5, the research house said the LSS5 tariff bids will be reflective of the sharp fall in global solar module prices, which have fallen over 60% after peaking in late 2021. Solar modules in turn, are estimated to have accounted for up to 50% of EPCC costs during the LSS4 construction.\u201cAs a result, we estimate overall EPCC cost would have fallen about 30% since LSS4, which would translate into lower tariff bids of around 14 to 16 sen per kilowatt-hour for LSS5 compared to a mean tariff bid of 20 sen per kilowatt-hour in LSS4.\u201cAs such, we believe potentially lower tariff bids is by no means a reflection of lower profitability for LSS5 projects,\u201d TA Research stated in a recent sector report.The evaluation of LSS5 bids have been completed and shortlisted bidders will be notified directly by the Energy Commissions from Dec 23, 2024 onwards.TA Research said more \u2018goodies\u2019 were announced by the Energy Transition and Water Transformation Ministry in regards to the solar for self-consumption (SelCo) programme. This builds on recent enhancements to the Net Energy Metering (NEM) programme.For context, the NEM programme essentially allows excess solar generation to be exported to the grid in return for credits to offset grid power consumption cost, while in contrast, SelCo is strictly for own usage.And like NEM, SelCo is primarily targeted towards rooftop solar installations, but the former is limited by quotas issued by the government.\u201cWe view the latest updates to the SelCo programme positively, in particular, the decision to expand SelCo to include ground-mounted and floating solar configurations, which could open up vast opportunities beyond just rooftop solar,\u201d it stated.Citing a study done by the Sustainable Energy Development Authority which noted rooftop solar accounts for 16% of the country\u2019s total solar source while ground-mounted solar for 78%.Hence, the SelCo programme which will open up ground-mounting configurations is likely to be received well by the industry as it could unlock new segments of opportunities for the RE industry and lessen the quota and auction cycle limitations in the LSS and CGPP programmes.Hence, TA Research maintained an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on the power and utilities sector, premised on demand-supply tightness in the generation market, record-high RE rollout, potential step up in grid capital expenditure and commencement of Malaysia\u2019s RE export.\u201cThe sector will continue to be driven by the energy transition backed by the NETRs aggressive 70% RE mix target by 2050, while the influx of data centre capacity is expected to drive strong demand growth, underpinning the requirement for new generation capacity,\u201d the research house added.It identified key beneficiaries within the RE EPCC sub-sector to include Samaiden Group Bhd, Solarvest Holdings Bhd, Sunview Group Bhd and Pekat Group Bhd.The key beneficiaries in the asset owner space \u2013 in regards to the LSS5 rollout \u2013 includes Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malakoff Corp Bhd and YTL Power International Bhd, TA Research forecast.",

However, the key risk this time around is if he drags the entire world into it as well with his proposed blanket 10-20 per cent tariff - the US was Malaysia\u2019s third largest export destination in 2023 at 11.3 per cent,\u201d it added.For now, the investment bank is maintaining its end-2024 FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI target at 1,700.\"Our investment themes on tourism recovery, energy transition, Johor\u2019s developmental reinvigoration and disposable income boosting measures should be fairly insulated the US election outcome - while trade war beneficiaries could see revived interest,\u201d said HLIB. - Bernama ",

If manufacturers cannot cut costs to offset the impact of higher tariffs, this could result in increased inflation and a subsequent decrease in consumer spending, posing risks to economic growth,\u201d AmInvest Research said.Furthermore, Trump\u2019s promise to impose new tariffs have resulted in businesses adopting measures such as accelerating shipments before tariffs are imposed, which has driven up trade activity.\u201cChina\u2019s exports expanded for the eighth consecutive month in November, while Malaysia\u2019s exports are anticipated to strengthen further in the coming months after rebounding by 1.5% year-on-year in October. This scenario, however, is partly dependent upon the performance of Malaysia\u2019s electrical and electronics (E&E) sector,\u201d it noted.In the first 10 months of 2024, Malaysia\u2019s exports increased by 4.8% year-on-year, increasing to RM1.24 trillion from RM1.19 trillion in the same period last year.\u201cThis growth was primarily driven by the E&E sector, which accounted for 39.5% of Malaysia\u2019s total exports. There were also notable contributions from other major products, such as palm oil, chemical products and machinery, as well as double-digit growth in rubber and rubber glove exports,\u201d AmInvest Research said.The research house said the declining PPI in Malaysia explains the low and stable inflation here.While the PPI tracks production costs and the consumer price index (CPI) measures consumer prices, analysis showed that PPI shocks typically affect the CPI within three months.\u201cWith subdued global demand and rising trade barriers, manufacturers are under increasing pressure to further reduce prices, which could amplify economic challenges,\u201d AmInvest Research noted.",

        "content": "A GROUP of disgruntled residents submitted a memorandum urging Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to disclose the list of recipients getting free units at a low-cost housing project in Jinjang Selatan Tambahan, Kepong.The units are part of a 35-storey block serving as alternative housing for squatters and longhouse residents in the area.The mixed development project is a joint venture between DBKL and a private developer to relocate first-generation settlers.A handful of residents held a peaceful protest before handing over the memorandum at DBKL\u2019s headquarters in Jalan Raja Laut, Kuala Lumpur, yesterday.Jawatankuasa Gabungan Isu Perumahan dan Pampasan secretary Ameer Khan Bargathalli said there were claims of outsiders receiving units.\u201cA balloting session for the units was held by the developer recently but we have no idea who these \u2018residents\u2019 are.\u201cDBKL should disclose the recipients\u2019 names to ensure transparency,\u201d he said when met.Ameer said the Jinjang Selatan Tambahan area had several shoplots, which had been home to 560 temporary occupational licence (TOL) holders.He said out of this figure, 220 were first-generation settlers who were promised free units at the low-cost housing project.He added that 340 second-generation settlers were promised units priced at RM200,000.StarMetro report on Dec 1, 2023.Ameer said the project for first-generation squatters was 80% completed but the building to accommodate second-generation settlers had yet to start.\u201cWe are seeking a meeting with mayor Datuk Seri Maimunah Mohd Sharif to iron out the issues,\u201d he added.The Jinjang Selatan Tambahan settlement started in 1969.The TOL subsequently issued by DBKL expired in 1996.It was reported that in 2004, residents\u2019 application for renewal of the TOL was rejected but they continued to pay assessment tax until 2006.In 2007, DBKL approved a mixed development project at the site.In a StarMetro report last year, shopowners received a notice to vacate, along with a promise that they would receive RM5,000 compensation and RM5,000 vouchers to buy a property worth at least RM300,000 at the mixed development project.However, the shopowners have received multiple extensions.DBKL, in a statement, said the alternative housing project was 88% completed and was expected to be ready by year end.It said balloting sessions, involving 237 first-generation families, were held on June 29 and 30 as well as July 13 and 14.An affordable housing project would also be built at the site but it was pending certain approvals, the statement read.DBKL said discussions had been ongoing with residents since 2019.\u201cResidents are allowed to stay put in Jinjang Selatan Tambahan and will only be required to move once the replacement project is completed,\u201d it said.As for the shopowners, DBKL said they could wait until the end of the year to vacate.

        "content": "REPEATED assurances during a public hearing have not allayed the fears of Ladang Bukit Jalil (LBJ) residents that they will not lose their homes near 6\u00bd Mile, Jalan Puchong in Kuala Lumpur.Kuala Lumpur Lands and Mines Office (PTGWP) officers said a recent notice proposing the degazettement of the land where the estate is situated, was not intended for any development or to displace the former rubber estate workers.Ladang Bukit Jalil Estate Workers\u2019 Action Committee secretary K. Balakrishnan said he was dissatisfied with the explanation given by PTGWP during an objection hearing.\u201cWe want someone from a higher authority (the relevant ministry) to come forward and talk to us and give us some reassurance.\u201cOn paper, we are squatting on the land that was only gazetted (public use) in 2009.\u201cThe LBJ estate and residents have been on the land since the 1940s and we have no rights. This is wrong,\u201d he told StarMetro.The remaining families at the former estate are urging the government to build low-cost homes on the existing 1.6ha land which also houses a Hindu temple.The objection hearing was regarding the degazettement of the Bukit Jalil land to realign and formalise the boundary between a Muslim burial ground and an Immigration depot in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur.Hisham says there are no plans to develop the area or disrupt the livelihoods of the estate workers.PTGWP technical enforcement sector deputy director Hisham Zulkifli said the degazettement was to address the boundary issue.He also said there were no plans to develop the area or disrupt the estate workers\u2019 livelihoods.\u201cWe are here today to correct a wrong done many years ago, where the current Immigration depot building encroached into the Muslim burial ground during construction,\u201d said Hisham.\u201cThe purpose of this hearing is to legalise the building by degazetting the land and regazetting the new boundaries.\u201dThe revocation exercise involves Lot 45585 \u2013 a 10.45ha parcel of land designated for public use, belonging to the Federal Territory Islamic Religious Department (Jawi).\u201cFollowing a decision by the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Land Exco (JKTWPKL), we are now initiating the process to split the land into two plots.\u201cThe land will be divided into Plot 1, reserved for the Islamic cemetery, and Plot 2, for the Immigration depot.\u201cThe original land reserve, which was gazetted on Nov 5, 2009, as public use for Muslim cemetery will become smaller,\u201d Hisham said.Save Kuala Lumpur Coalition chairman Datuk M. Ali, who attended the objection hearing with his team, questioned how such blatant land encroachment could occur.Hisham said the hearing was not to place blame but to correct the mistake.StarMetro report on Oct 15.LBJ Estate Residents Committee advisor S. Arutchelvan said LBJ was one of two plantations owned by the same company, Bukit Jalil Estate Agencies (Kinrara Group Estates Sdn Bhd).\u201cLBJ was acquired by the government, the other plantation remained under private ownership.\u201cThe privately-owned Kinrara Estate provided its workers with land and built low-cost terrace houses, which they could purchase for as little as RM5,000. Facilities like the temple and schools were also preserved for the community.\u201cIn contrast, the fate of workers at Ladang Bukit Jalil, the estate acquired by the government, has been less favourable.\u201cThe irony is that had Ladang Bukit Jalil remained in private hands, the former workers could have enjoyed better benefits, like their counterparts in Kinrara Estate, and would now be living in landed properties,\u201d said Arutchelvan.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: CIMB Group Holdings Bhd\u2019s earnings for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (3Q24) are likely to be decent amid marginal sequential net interest margin (NIM) improvement despite softer loan growth and robust non-interest income (NOII).According to Maybank Investment Bank Research (Maybank Research), CIMB\u2019s 3Q24 results, which are expected to be announced on Nov 28, will show NIM to have picked up sequentially for the third consecutive quarter.However, the research house believes it will be more challenging to sustain such margins in 4Q24, given the expected seasonal pick-up in deposit competition.Maybank Research noted the credit cost environment remained benign and weaker currencies have had a manageable impact on regional contributions.\u201cWe maintain our forecasts and our financial year 2024 (FY24) return on equity (ROE) of 11.1% is at the lower end of management\u2019s 11% to 11.5% target,\u201d it said.The research house maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the bank with an unchanged target price of RM9.20 a share.Similarly, Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research expects resilient reporting ahead, whereby the broad 3Q24 operational trends are up to expectations.The research house kept its FY24-FY26 forecasts for CIMB, anticipating to see steady NIM, robust NOII and higher net credit cost in CIMB\u2019s upcoming quarterly results.It pointed out that the bank\u2019s NIM in 3Q24 was well supported sequentially (2Q24: up four basis points quarter-on-quarter), given lower funding cost from downward repricing of retail deposits and strict wholesale pricing at Malaysia and Singapore.The research house added CIMB saw a broadly stable NIM in Thailand, but these are bounded by Indonesia\u2019s NIM contraction as it was hit by lower loan yield and higher deposit cost. It highlighted rivalry for deposits heated up in October but was nowhere as intense compared to the level experienced back in 4Q22 and 1Q23.\u201cOverall, we still think CIMB\u2019s risk-reward profile is balanced. In the short term, we remain a tad concerned on whether its big NOII can be sustained, especially when its fair value through other comprehensive income reserve is still negative,\u201d it said.HLIB Research retained a \u201chold\u201d call on CIMB with a target price of RM8.40 a share, with the valuation based on 1.2 times FY25 price-to-book ratio.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian property market in 2025 is expected to continue seeing steady demand for residential properties, especially affordable housing.AmInvestment Research, in a recent report, said the local residential property market is anticipated to maintain its momentum going forward.Demand for residential property was robust in the first half of 2024 with total number and value of residential property transactions rising by 6.1% and 10.4% year-on-year respectively, based on the National Property Information Centre (Napic).\u201cWe expect the momentum to continue due to favourable government policy to support the affordable housing segment, relaunching of the Malaysia My Second Home programme and sustained positive labour market conditions,\u201d the research house stated.Meanwhile, an analyst told StarBiz demand for industrial properties and affordable homes have been steady.\u201cDemand for industrial properties has picked up significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic, while affordable housing will always be sought after by potential buyers,\u201d he said.According to Napic, the third quarter of financial year 2024 (3Q24) saw a slight increase in both volume and value of housing transactions, with 70,520 units recorded (3Q23: 68,561 units) worth RM28.74bil versus RM28.36bil a year ago.Overall, the property market performance improved with the number and transaction value rising by 3.1% and 0.3%, respectively.This comprises 112,305 transactions valued at RM57.31bil, compared with 108,993 transactions worth RM57.14bil in 3Q23.Phillip Capital Research said property transactions in the first half of 2024 trended positively, with value and volume posting a 10% and 6% y-o-y growth, respectively.\u201cThe affordable housing segment (below RM300,000) remained the primary driver, accounting for more than 53% of total residential transactions and signs of gradual easing in the overhang.\u201dIt added that the upcoming minimum wage hike announced in Budget 2025 may further bolster demand.Another key focus for 2025 will be industrial property development, particularly in foreign direct investment hotspots such as Penang and Johor, with global trade diversion likely to intensify under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, as well as the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone expected to spur industry property activity in Johor.\u201cThe industrial land sales to data centre operators present another growth avenue, as developers monetise landbanks and reinvest in strategic lands.\u201dThe research house noted that several developers, including Sime Darby Property Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and Mah Sing Group Bhd are exploring data centre investments to meet growing demands.Year-to-date, Phillip Capital noted that the KL Property Index (comprising the listed shares of property companies) has risen 25.8%, driven by positive sentiment surrounding data centre expansions, especially in Johor.Nevertheless the research house added while the market shows signs of improvement with oversupply easing, underlying demand remains subdued.\u201cWe maintain our neutral stance on the sector, adopting a cherry-picking strategy focusing on the affordable housing segment.\u201dPhilip Capital thus prefers developers with exposure to the industrial property and affordable housing segments.\u201cAME Elite Consortium Bhd is a key proxy to Johor and Penang\u2019s booming industrial property market and is poised to benefit from rising foreign direct investment inflows.\u201cSkyworld Development Bhd offers exposure in Penang in the affordable housing space, while Lagenda Properties Bhd is a preferred proxy for affordable housing in Johor and Kedah.\u201dGoing forward, the research house said it projects the aggregate property sector earnings to grow 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2025.\u201cLagenda is expected to record a 25% y-o-y earnings growth, supported by strong sales momentum and solid take-up rates.\u201cSkyworld\u2019s earnings are expected to see strong growth in 2025, underpinned by an increase in project launches.\u201dMeanwhile, Maybank Investment Bank Research said 2025 is set to be eventful with corporate exercises like the listing of Sunway Bhd\u2019s healthcare business, as well as investment properties of S P Setia Bhd and WCT Holdings Bhd, to name a few.It said thematic drivers such as data centre-related investments and land sales, are expected to sustain interests in property stocks, which have the relevant exposure.\u201cSime Darby Property recently secured another 20-year lease with Google for its Elmina Business Park (77 acres), while Eco World Development Group Bhd is pursuing more data centre deals in its Selangor and Kulai (Johor) industrial parks.\u201dAdditionally, the research house noted S P Setia is expected to finalise its Tanjung Kupang industrial park joint venture in Johor by the first half of 2025.",

        "title": "Healthy domestic growth to offset US trade tariffs",
        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian economy is exposed to repercussions of a change in the United States trade policy under the Trump administration, especially from the imposition of tariffs.CGS International (CGSI) Research however expects that to be offset by a healthy domestic economy, supported by Putrajaya\u2019s policies on wages and the spillover from robust growth in investment.The research house warned downside risks could emanate from possible demand weakness amid higher taxes and subsidy removals, as well as any negative implications from Trump\u2019s tariff policy on the exports sector.It expects Malaysia\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 4.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2025 from 5.2% this year due to external headwinds.\u201cEncouraging labour market, wage reform measures as well as improvement in tourism related sectors should continue to anchor domestic demand. External demand could face hurdles following Trump\u2019s tariff policy.\u201cHowever, a second wave of supply chain restructuring could boost GDP growth,\u201d CGSI Research stated in its Asean focused economic report.It forecast private consumption growth of 5.7% y-o-y in 2025, driven by labour reforms including several wage hikes as well as the larger cash assistance programme.\u201cWe anticipate an increase in disposable income from the first tranche of civil servant salary hikes in December 2024 and higher minimum wage of RM1,700 (an increase of 13%) starting in February 2025 to boost consumption.In addition, government measures such as the Progressive Wage programme, multi-tier foreign worker levy, pension contribution for foreign workers and higher allocation in training programmes will likely assist in spurring the labour market as well through upskilling and training,\u201d CGSI Research stated.The research outfit expects the country\u2019s gross fixed capital formation to moderate from 11.7% in 2024 to 4.1% y-o-y in 2025, partly due to the high base effect from the robust foreign direct investment growth year-to-date.The United States-Sino trade tensions spillover effect could see Malaysia attract companies interested in expanding outside China ahead of Trump\u2019s upcoming trade policies (China + 1 strategy).Investments could also be driven by government initiatives such as the construction of the Penang Light Rail Transit, which is set to begin in early 2025.The RM120bil five-year GEAR-uP programme (which will see RM120bil channelled directly into the local economy through direct domestic investment) should boost corporate capital spending and infrastructure development.The research house also expects further cuts in the United States Federal Fund rate in 2025 will help the ringgit, assuming interest differentials narrow.The outlook for the local unit would also depend on factors like global economic conditions. CGSI Research forecasts the ringgit to strengthen to 4.25 against the greenback by end of 2025 from about 4.4 at present.\u201cThe US dollar could strengthen amid the flight to safety, given the high uncertainties. However, a narrowing rate differential favouring Malaysia could strengthen the ringgit,\u201d it said.Key downside risks to the forecast include a change in the appetite of government-linked investment companies on repatriation and conversion of foreign currency proceeds.With the Trump presidency presenting risks to trade and investments. CGSI Research expects real exports to moderate by 4.6% y-o-y in 2025 (2024: 9.3%) driven by the growth in the electrical and electronics sector.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The increased allocation for the Housing and Local Government Ministry underscored its role in spearheading government policies to enhance the living standards and quality of life for Malaysians, says Nga Kor Ming (pic).The Housing and Local Government Minister said the RM5.934bil allocation in Budget 2025, is a 5.08% increase (RM287.4mil) from the RM5.647bil in 2024.Lauding the Budget 2025 as \"impressive, progressive, inclusive and sustainable\", he said the budget was aligned with the Madani economy framework, noting its potential to reduce the fiscal deficit from 6% in 2022 to 3.8% next year amidst fiscal challenges and regional conflicts.\"The budget's reforms are also expected to enhance government revenue by reducing leakages and wastage,\" he said on Friday (Oct 18).Highlighting the necessity of reforms, Nga said the targeted subsidy plan for RON95 fuel would help save RM8bil for national development.\"Moreover, the budget dedicates RM15.9bil to social safety nets, assisting the hardcore poor, B40 and M40 groups.\"The lowest income families will receive RM13,000 in financial aid, marking the highest social welfare allocation in history, This shows the Madani government's commitment to its people.\"We are grateful that 14 of our financial initiatives have been approved,\" Nga said, specifically mentioning the RM200mil for maintaining low-cost public housing, RM289mil for constructing and upgrading markets, RM100mil for Madani recreational parks, and nearly RM1bil allocated for social and affordable housing.In a statement, Nga said the significant allocation was a testament to the trust and confidence of the Madani government in the ministry to continue empowering the agenda for public well-being and a sustainable environment.The Budget 2025 allocation focuses on five key sectors for the ministry: housing, local government, urban sustainability and community well-being, firefighting services and the circular economy.It outlines 13 initiatives poised to address pressing issues and drive development.Among the highlights are RM10bil for the Housing Credit Guarantee Scheme (SJKP) and step-up financing; RM900mil for projects under the People's Residency Program (PRR) and Rumah Mesra Rakyat (RMR), including two new developments in Port Dickson and Seberang Prai Tengah; an increase in the ceiling for new home assistance to RM90,000 and up to RM20,000 for home repairs; and RM200mil for the maintenance of low- and medium-cost public strata housing, focusing on replacing outdated elevators.Others included tax relief on home loan interest for properties priced up to RM750,000, valid from Jan 1, 2025, to Dec 31, 2027; RM100mil to build and repair market stalls and infrastructure across local authority areas; and RM150mil for cleaning and upgrading drainage systems in local authority areas.A total of RM84mil has been allocated to enhance basic and social facilities in Chinese New Villages, with the ministry coordinating needs in Indian settlements; RM50mil to repairs and maintenance of registered non-Muslim places of worship; and RM100mil for upgrading 48 Madani public parks across the nation.Besides, RM1.8bil has been allocated for building and maintaining civil servant quarters, including those of the Fire and Rescue Department; extended social protection for all civil servants and the ex-gratia disaster scheme for Bomba personnel; and promotion of the circular economy through tax incentives or sponsorship for household composting machines and smart AI-driven reverse vending machines until 2027.

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Following a steady performance this year, the Malaysian property market is expected to resume its stable growth momentum into 2025.PPC International Sdn Bhd managing director Datuk Siders Sittampalam said the outlook for 2025 remains \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\u201cThe affordable housing segment will likely continue to dominate, as first-time buyers benefit from government incentives and targeted financing programmes.\u201dTo boost the property market\u2019s growth momentum next year, Siders said stakeholders will need to focus on enhancing policy frameworks, supporting affordable housing initiatives and leveraging strategic infrastructure projects to stimulate regional growth.\u201cWith sustained demand in well-connected urban centres and industrial hotspots, Malaysia\u2019s property market is poised for gradual but stable recovery in the years ahead.\u201dSiders noted that key opportunities include strategic infrastructure projects, such as the East Coast Rail Link, which promises to rejuvenate previously overlooked areas and unlock new investment opportunities.PPC International MD Datuk Siders Sittampalam\u201cWhile policy-based enablers such as adjustments to the Malaysia My Second Home programme could further stimulate the market to some extent.\u201cNevertheless, economic uncertainties and affordability concerns pose ongoing challenges,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, down south, Olive Property Consultants chief executive officer (CEO) Samuel Tan said there has been increased confidence in Johor\u2019s property market, following the slew of announcements and initiatives taken by the federal and state governments.\u201cJohor\u2019s ability to attract foreign direct investments, especially in the data centre, logistics, electrical and electronics and renewable energy segments are signs of improving economic performance.\u201cAll these are followed by job creation and more business opportunities,\u201d he told StarBiz.Tan noted that property transactions, in particular the residential sub-sector, has increased substantially both in terms of volume and price since borders reopened in April 2022.\u201cAfter nearly a decade of downturn, the market has finally recovered.\u201cSome of the reasons for the robust residential market are pent-up demand post-Covid-19; high accommodation cost in Singapore; high additional buyer stamp duty imposed for foreigners; and anticipation of the positive impact from catalytic initiatives like the Special Financial Zone at Forest City, the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and the Rapid Transit System (RTS).\u201dTan said other catalysts include government initiatives such as the stamp duty exemption for first time house buyers, interest rate deduction for loan on purchase of residential houses for a specific period, as well as the Madani deposit for those who require initial funds for house purchases.\u201cThe fear of inflation is also causing people to invest in properties as a hedge against rising costs such as land, building construction, labour and compliance costs.\u201cHigher disposable incomes will be translated into property investment,\u201d he said.On another note, Tan said Johor has consistently recorded high overhang volumes.\u201cAlthough property experts have said that the overhang situation is improving, recent reports by the National Property Information Centre (Napic) still show high numbers of new developments.\u201dOverhang refers to those completed properties that remained unsold for nine months after launch.Olive Tree Property Consultants chief executive officer Samuel Tan.Tan, however, noted that developers have been managing to clear quite a lot of unsold stocks over the past few years.\u201cWe noticed that the sales of new developments are also good. This is especially so for high-rise projects located near the Johor Baru city centre and RTS terminal.\u201cAs such, we believe there is definitely an increased demand for residential properties from both Malaysians (especially those working in Singapore) and Singaporeans and other foreigners.\u201dHaving said that, Tan said the constant supply of properties, especially high-rise development with high plot ratio, is a concern.\u201cDevelopers must be discerning enough not to launch their projects if the anticipated take-up rates are uncertain.\u201cNevertheless, new project launches, including service apartments in popular locations that are rightly priced, have been absorbed by the market,\u201d he said.According to Napic data, the third quarter of financial year 2024 (3Q24) saw a slight increase in both volume and value of housing transactions, with 70,520 units recorded (3Q23: 68,561 units) worth RM28.74bil versus RM28.36bil a year ago.Overall, the property market performance improved with the number and transaction value rising by 3.1% and 0.3%, respectively.This comprises 112,305 transactions valued at RM57.31bil, compared with 108,993 transactions worth RM57.14bil in 3Q23.Rahim & Co International Sdn Bhd real estate agency CEO Siva Shanker said he expects positive growth for the property market in 2025, emphasising however that it will be marginal.\u201cThere will be some normalisation in the property market and the growth will be organic, going forward. Gone are the days when we used to see the sector rising or falling by 20% to 30%.\u201cHowever, this is good, as it is more sustainable. It\u2019s better to have slow and steady growth for long term prospects,\u201d he said.On the outlook of property stocks going forward, Maybank Investment Bank Research said 2025 is set to be eventful with corporate exercises like the listing of Sunway Bhd\u2019s healthcare business, as well as investment properties of S P Setia Bhd and WCT Holdings Bhd, to name a few.\u201cThematic drivers like data centre-related investments and land sales are expected to sustain interests in property stocks, which have the relevant exposure.\u201cSime Darby Property Bhd recently secured another 20-year lease with Google for its Elmina Business Park (77 acres), while Eco World Development Group Bhd is pursuing more data centre deals in its Selangor and Kulai (Johor) industrial parks.\u201dAdditionally, the research house also highlighted that S P Setia is expected to finalise its Tanjung Kupang industrial park joint venture by the first half of 2025.As the year comes to a close, Siders said the Malaysian property market in 2024 exhibited an adjustment phase, gradually moving towards a more stable and positive trajectory, influenced by evolving economic conditions and buyer preferences.\u201cThe residential property sector continued to dominate transactions, bolstered by demand in urban centres like Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Johor and Penang.\u201cDemand for affordable homes, particularly those priced below RM500,000, was robust, as they catered to first-time buyers and owner-occupiers.\u201dSiders said many developers adopted a cautious approach, with new launches concentrating on smaller-scale phases.\u201cThis strategy contributed to a slight improvement in the residential overhang, reflecting healthier absorption rates.\u201dSiders believes landed homes are expected to remain a top preference for homebuyers.\u201cThis is provided they are offered on an affordable and competitive price point, whilst properties near public transportation hubs attracted interest, particularly for rental purposes, given the growing demand from young professionals and working adults.\u201dSeparately, Siders said the industrial property market stood out as a resilient segment as it has been since post-Covid-19, driven by high-tech manufacturing, eCommerce and logistics.\u201cStrategic locations such as Johor and Klang Valley gained traction due to initiatives like the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and the ongoing growth of high-quality industrial parks.\u201cInvestors remained interested in niche products such as sustainable logistics spaces and integrated industrial developments, reinforcing this sector as a stable pillar of growth.\u201d",

        "title": "Experts suggest more affordable housing near transit hubs to help urban poor get around",
        "content": "PETALING JAYA: With the surging cost of living in the Klang Valley, interest groups say improving the public transport system is important to help people cope with their transport expenses.They said that expanding affordable housing near transit hubs, improving service reliability, and addressing last-mile challenges would be crucial in reducing urban poverty.\u201cThe lack of integrated public transport forces reliance on personal vehicles, raising commuting costs significantly,\u201d said Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association (Fomca) vice-president Datuk Indrani Thuraisingham.The Klang Valley, which is Malaysia\u2019s economic and administrative hub, attracts businesses, industries, and work opportunities, she said.\u201cThis creates a demand for housing, goods, and services, which inflates prices,\u201d she said in an interview yesterday.Despite expansions in the MRT, LRT, and BRT, Indrani said poor last-mile connectivity had led to a reliance on costly transport alternatives.\u201cFomca recommends integrated transit solutions with seamless connections between modes like buses, trains, and last-mile options like e-scooters, bicycles, and shuttle services.\u201cIntroduce affordable fare options and develop a centralised app for real-time transit information to boost public transport use,\u201d she said.To address rising costs in the Klang Valley, Indrani suggested expanding affordable housing by using underutilised public land, supporting rent-to-own schemes, and implementing rent control.She called for transit-oriented development (TOD) to reduce car reliance and inmpovements in public transport, including enhanced last-mile connectivity and subsidised commuter passes.Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology\u2019s Centre for Business and Policy Research chairman Dr Foo Lee Peng agreed that more should be done to reduce urban poverty amid rising living costs in the Klang Valley.\u201cSocial programmes need wider reach, and public transport enhancements \u2013 such as MRT and LRT extensions \u2013 must address last-mile connectivity to improve accessibility for the urban poor.\u201cAlso, targeted skills training in high-demand sectors is essential for economic empowerment.\u201cDespite promising initiatives, delays and infrastructure gaps hinder their impact, necessitating stronger coordination and long-term planning for affordable housing and TOD,\u201d she said.Foo said the higher living costs in the Klang Valley were due to limited land which increases property prices, while poor public transport necessitates costly car ownership.\u201cTo mitigate expenses, individuals can enhance financial literacy using tools like the Belanjawanku guide, adopt cost-saving practices like carpooling, and explore affordable housing options.\u201dAt the government level, Foo said the authorities can address these issues by expanding transparent public housing, improving transport infrastructure with better last-mile connectivity, and providing targeted subsidies for essentials.\u201cCoupled with subsidies, it can make public transport a viable and cost-effective alternative to car ownership,\u201d she added.Foo noted that efforts to combat urban poverty in the Klang Valley have shown progress, but said they need further improvement.\u201cWhile MRT and LRT expansions have improved public transport, gaps in last-mile connectivity, such as linking train stations to residential areas, continue to limit accessibility for the urban poor.\u201cDespite positive initiatives under the National Transport Policy, delays and inadequate infrastructure reduce their impact.\u201cStronger collaboration among governments, businesses, and communities, along with long-term planning for affordable housing and TOD, is crucial for sustainable improvement,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Despite the anticipated price volatility for construction materials due to potential tariffs by the incoming US administration, the general outlook for building materials remains positive.This is premised on the expected increase in demand, drive by higher government infrastructure spending in Malaysia as well as the stimulus measures by China.These factors led CIMB Research to maintain its \u201coverweight\u201d rating on the building materials sector.In its report, the research house acknowledged that while tariff issues would dominate the outlook for the building materials sector in 2025, favourable demand dynamics and supportive policy measures would underpin the sector\u2019s growth potential.\u201cAlthough the incoming US administration\u2019s tariff policies could induce greater price volatility for construction materials in the near term, we expect the phased ramp-up in government infrastructure spending to drive higher demand for key inputs such as cement and steel in the coming months,\u201d it explained.\u201cMoreover, additional stimulus from China would help put a floor on building material prices,\u201d it added.CIMB Research retained Malayan Cement Bhd (MCement) and Ann Joo Resources Bhd as its top picks for exposure to the sector.On the steel segment, the research house noted that the outlook remained challenging amid rising costs and global uncertainties.It pointed out that the Malaysian Iron and Steel Association has warned of increased operating expenses due to the proposed carbon tax, the multi-tier levy system and mandatory Employees Provident Fund contributions for foreign workers under Budget 2025.In addition, cheap steel imports continued to undercut domestic prices, while tariff uncertainties under the incoming US administration would drive market volatility.However, barring a full-blown trade war, CIMB Research said additional US steel tariffs are unlikely, noting, \u201cThe threat of additional steel tariffs appears remote for now\u201d, as China steel already faces cumulative import duties of 50% under the Biden administration.Further, the research house said, there are mitigating circumstances that could support the domestic steel industry.\u201cFirst, we anticipate that local steel prices could fluctuate in the near term, before normalising in 2025 as steel millers pass on the incremental costs to end-clients,\u201d it said.\u201cSecond, to level the playing field, Malaysia\u2019s steel imports will likely be subject to the aforementioned proposed carbon tax, with proceeds to be channelled towards the country\u2019s green transition fund.\u201cThird, and most significantly, there are growing signs that China could unveil fresh stimulus in 2025 that will help reverse the proliferation of cheap steel imports currently weighing on regional steel prices,\u201d it added.On aluminium, CIMB Research said the segment would likely receive a short-term boost from the removal of Chinese export rebates.\u201cAluminium prices have jumped as much as 6% on the London Market Exchange after the Chinese government announced on Nov 15 the removal of a 13% rebate on value-added tax for aluminium exports effective Dec 1.\u201cWe opine that the positive price impact was in anticipation of a potential five-million-tonne decline in Chinese aluminium products in the international market,\u201d it said.\u201cAlthough a reduction in Chinese export volumes is likely to provide a significant boost to aluminium prices, we flag that supply may creep up again once Chinese exporters adjust to the new cost structure, much like what happened to its galvanised steel exports after tax rebates for plates and sheets were removed in 2020,\u201d it added.Meanwhile, CIMB Research noted that of late, a number of building materials players have either expanded vertically, or ventured into downstream business activities.For instance, on June 20 this year, the PT Lumintu-Ann Joo Consortium secured a RM298mil contract to undertake electrification-related services for the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).\u201cThe ECRL contract came as a pleasant surprise, as it broadens Ann Joo\u2019s existing role beyond that of a supplier of steel products to encompass the provision of electrification-related services as well.\u201cThe strategic move will help Ann Joo diversify its earnings base, with a keen eye on Malaysia\u2019s energy transition market, anchored by RM16bil in joint investments between Tenaga Nasional Bhd and UEM Lestari Bhd aimed at strengthening the national grid and decarbonising industrial areas,\u201d CIMB Research said.\u201cWe are also mildly positive on YTL Cement Bhd\u2019s acquisition of Singapore-based Industrial Buildings System manufacturer NSL Ltd.\u201cIt will create synergistic demand for MCement\u2019s cement and pre-cast concrete products.\u201cThe acquisition also creates new channels for MCement to support parent YTL Cement\u2019s expansion into IBS through the supply of cement-related products via its Pasir Gudang plant in Johor, including to the Singaporean market, which accounted for about 5% of YTL Cement\u2019s revenue over the past two fiscal years,\u201d it added.",

        "content": "HONG KONG (SCMP): Michelle Yeoh understood enough Cantonese when it mattered. Even though the name \u201cSing Lung\u201d didn\u2019t immediately ring a bell, she still accepted her first on-screen gig in 1980s Hong Kong \u2013 a commercial with, as it turned out, Jackie Chan \u2013 which would lead ultimately to her international film career.Michael Wong was a Chinese-educated choirboy who went on to crack the Mandopop market in 1990s Taiwan and win acclaim as a balladeer in the wider Chinese-speaking world.Like Yeoh and Wong before me, I grew up in Ipoh, a Chinese-dominated city in Malaysia.For my generation, a wide exposure to Chinese culture and a decades-long emphasis on Chinese-medium education are paying off in a bigger way than I could have imagined, with the transformation of mainland China into an economic and technological power.Around Ipoh, ethnic Chinese children have often grown up between languages. At home, my parents spoke Cantonese, and we lapped up TVB dramas and Cantopop songs from Hong Kong.A class at Damansara Chinese National School in Kuala Lumpur in 2001. -- Photo: APBut when I went to school, I learned to read and write simplified Chinese \u2013 not the traditional script that is used in Hong Kong \u2013 and all subjects at the primary-school level were taught in Mandarin.At the public secondary school I attended, the medium of instruction switched to Malay, the national language, but Chinese and English were compulsory subjects.That is how I came to have a perfect command of Mandarin, and to consider it more of a mother tongue than Cantonese.It\u2019s also natural that many of my schoolmates would be tuned in to the latest Mandopop hits from Taiwan, by singers like Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai.At the time, Taiwanese idol dramas and variety shows were common entertainment options, in the absence of strong alternatives from mainland China.Many Malaysian Chinese had been drawn to Taiwan for the longest time, whether as a tourist, student or expat destination, due to a unique combination of \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d factors.On the one hand, Taiwan offers scholarships to overseas Chinese students; on the other hand, Malaysia continues to give the Malay majority preferential access to resources from higher education to housing under the bumiputra or \u201csons of the soil\u201d policy, in the name of tackling inequality.I was often told by the older generation that this is the price our community had to pay for being allowed to develop the most comprehensive education track in Chinese outside China \u2013 more than 1,200 Chinese vernacular primary schools, and around 150 government or independent Chinese high schools \u2013 instead of assimilating.But despite the focus on Chinese-medium education, mainland China wasn\u2019t on the radar of my generation of students, outside of history books. It wasn\u2019t on the news much. Early in the 2000s, I had to hear from a handful of relatives and friends who had visited about what an exciting place it was and how it was constantly improving.A view of Beijing\u2019s central business district from the Drum Tower on September 25. --Photo: EPA-EFE via SCMPThis shiny new China only became highly visible during the Beijing 2008 Olympics, shortly before I graduated from secondary school. Amid intense international media coverage of China\u2019s modernisation drive in the run-up to the sporting event, the Bird\u2019s Nest and Water Cube stadiums were soon the coolest buildings in the region.The country also grew in my peers\u2019 estimation when it achieved its best Olympic results ever, taking more gold medals than the United States.While China now had our attention, we weren\u2019t completely sold on it until the 2010s, when it not only became the world\u2019s second largest economy but also started producing regionally successful television programmes.More of my friends and relatives started travelling to the country for business, pleasure or to visit their ancestral homes. I, too, jumped on this bandwagon in 2016, hoping to explore a hitherto unfamiliar part of my heritage; it had also been my childhood dream to go on an adventure discovering the ancient Silk Road for myself.My first stop in China was Beijing. To see the Chinese capital\u2019s modern prosperity up close was to believe it.From Beijing, I then travelled all the way west to the China-Pakistan border. Traversing the country, I noticed how Han Chinese culture varied by region; I also saw a wealth of ethnic minority cultures, not to mention sprawling landscapes along the Great Wall and the Gobi Desert. The sights were mesmerising, and it was an intellectually rewarding journey.Culture-wise, I must admit that a northern Chinese city like Beijing felt a little strange to someone with southern Chinese roots. The rolled-tongue Beijing pronunciation of Mandarin took getting used to, as did the northern Chinese preference for noodles and buns, over rice.I still remember how surprised a food vendor was, when I asked in Mandarin for a fork and a spoon to eat with. In China, all meals can be attacked with chopsticks, whereas Malaysian Chinese like me are accustomed to eating rice off plates, with forks and spoons, and using chopsticks to pick up noodles.Differences aside, it was a fruitful experience observing the vastness and diversity of mainland China, and an eye-opener after years of connecting to Chinese culture mostly through Taiwan.While I proudly carry a Malaysian passport, my knowledge of Chinese has proved to be a vital, invisible passport to China, whether to delve into Chinese civilisation, soak up contemporary Chinese culture or seize new opportunities.More broadly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this without the benefit of the education I received in a multilingual society like Malaysia. For that, I\u2019m grateful to be a Malaysian Chinese.Chee Yik-wai is a Malaysia-based intercultural specialist and the co-founder of Crowdsukan focusing on sport diplomacy for peace and development. - SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST ",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian property market in 2025 is expected to continue seeing steady demand for residential properties, especially affordable housing.AmInvestment Research, in a recent report, said the local residential property market is anticipated to maintain its momentum going forward.Demand for residential property was robust in the first half of 2024 with total number and value of residential property transactions rising by 6.1% and 10.4% year-on-year respectively, based on the National Property Information Centre (Napic).\u201cWe expect the momentum to continue due to favourable government policy to support the affordable housing segment, relaunching of the Malaysia My Second Home programme and sustained positive labour market conditions,\u201d the research house stated.Meanwhile, an analyst told StarBiz demand for industrial properties and affordable homes have been steady.\u201cDemand for industrial properties has picked up significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic, while affordable housing will always be sought after by potential buyers,\u201d he said.According to Napic, the third quarter of financial year 2024 (3Q24) saw a slight increase in both volume and value of housing transactions, with 70,520 units recorded (3Q23: 68,561 units) worth RM28.74bil versus RM28.36bil a year ago.Overall, the property market performance improved with the number and transaction value rising by 3.1% and 0.3%, respectively.This comprises 112,305 transactions valued at RM57.31bil, compared with 108,993 transactions worth RM57.14bil in 3Q23.Phillip Capital Research said property transactions in the first half of 2024 trended positively, with value and volume posting a 10% and 6% y-o-y growth, respectively.\u201cThe affordable housing segment (below RM300,000) remained the primary driver, accounting for more than 53% of total residential transactions and signs of gradual easing in the overhang.\u201dIt added that the upcoming minimum wage hike announced in Budget 2025 may further bolster demand.Another key focus for 2025 will be industrial property development, particularly in foreign direct investment hotspots such as Penang and Johor, with global trade diversion likely to intensify under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, as well as the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone expected to spur industry property activity in Johor.\u201cThe industrial land sales to data centre operators present another growth avenue, as developers monetise landbanks and reinvest in strategic lands.\u201dThe research house noted that several developers, including Sime Darby Property Bhd, UEM Sunrise Bhd and Mah Sing Group Bhd are exploring data centre investments to meet growing demands.Year-to-date, Phillip Capital noted that the KL Property Index (comprising the listed shares of property companies) has risen 25.8%, driven by positive sentiment surrounding data centre expansions, especially in Johor.Nevertheless the research house added while the market shows signs of improvement with oversupply easing, underlying demand remains subdued.\u201cWe maintain our neutral stance on the sector, adopting a cherry-picking strategy focusing on the affordable housing segment.\u201dPhilip Capital thus prefers developers with exposure to the industrial property and affordable housing segments.\u201cAME Elite Consortium Bhd is a key proxy to Johor and Penang\u2019s booming industrial property market and is poised to benefit from rising foreign direct investment inflows.\u201cSkyworld Development Bhd offers exposure in Penang in the affordable housing space, while Lagenda Properties Bhd is a preferred proxy for affordable housing in Johor and Kedah.\u201dGoing forward, the research house said it projects the aggregate property sector earnings to grow 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2025.\u201cLagenda is expected to record a 25% y-o-y earnings growth, supported by strong sales momentum and solid take-up rates.\u201cSkyworld\u2019s earnings are expected to see strong growth in 2025, underpinned by an increase in project launches.\u201dMeanwhile, Maybank Investment Bank Research said 2025 is set to be eventful with corporate exercises like the listing of Sunway Bhd\u2019s healthcare business, as well as investment properties of S P Setia Bhd and WCT Holdings Bhd, to name a few.It said thematic drivers such as data centre-related investments and land sales, are expected to sustain interests in property stocks, which have the relevant exposure.\u201cSime Darby Property recently secured another 20-year lease with Google for its Elmina Business Park (77 acres), while Eco World Development Group Bhd is pursuing more data centre deals in its Selangor and Kulai (Johor) industrial parks.\u201dAdditionally, the research house noted S P Setia is expected to finalise its Tanjung Kupang industrial park joint venture in Johor by the first half of 2025.",

There is urgency when it comes to building affordable housing for the people,\u201d he said.ALSO READ: Madani blocks a must in new housing projects, says PMLocated on two prime plots of land in Penang\u201413ha in Seberang Jaya and 65.3ha in Batu Kawan\u2014the project will deliver over 30,000 affordable housing and Rumah Bakat Baru Madani units, priced between RM225,000 and RM420,000.Both Seberang Jaya and Batu Kawan play crucial roles in Penang's economic landscape, particularly within the thriving electrical and electronics (E&E) sector.Seberang Jaya has evolved into a bustling township with strategic connectivity and robust infrastructure, becoming a key component of the rapidly growing Seberang Perai region, which has seen a 27% population increase since 2008, fuelling demand for housing and community amenities.Batu Kawan, often dubbed Penang\u2019s emerging \"Silicon Valley of the East,\" has been identified as the state\u2019s next major growth hub.ALSO READ: Call for more RMR projects, homeownership support in Budget 2025In his speech, Chow said the development is in line with the state\u2019s Penang2030 vision, which prioritises livability and socioeconomic growth.He said the new housing scheme addresses the rising demand for affordable homes driven by the state\u2019s thriving industrial economy, which continues to attract domestic and international talent.\u201cThe Rumah Bakat Baru Madani concept is a game-changer. It offers opportunities for both Penangites and non-Penangites working here to own homes, ensuring inclusivity and equity in housing,\u201d he said.Nga said the project aligns with Malaysia Madani\u2019s principles of harmony (kesejahteraan).He lauded SkyWorld Development\u2019s pivotal role in this initiative, adding that such a significant feat deserves a place in the Malaysia Book of Records.\u201cIt is a model for other states to emulate, ensuring quality affordable housing remains a priority,\u201d Nga added.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Property developer Skyworld Development Bhd has tied up with the Penang Development Corp (PDC) to jointly develop the country\u2019s largest affordable-housing project, worth RM13bil, in Penang.The real estate firm signed a joint development agreement with PDC, as well as its subsidiary, PDC Properties, yesterday, for the development of Rumah Bakat Baru Madani located in Seberang Jaya and Batu Kawan.Spanning close to 200-acres of land, the development will consist of two residential blocks catered to the B40 and M40 groups.Set to become the largest affordable housing development in Malaysia, the block in Batu Kawan will be offering 30,000 units, while the one in Seberang Jaya will hold about 6,000 units.With a combined offering of about 36,000 units, SkyWorld chief executive officer Lee Chee Seng said the project will act as a cornerstone of the Malaysian government\u2019s commitment to deliver 500,000 affordable homes by 2025, as included in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (RMK12).As of October 2024, 89% of the target has been reached, with 443,259 units completed.Lee said the affordable housing market will continue to be robust in the next five years.\u201cWe will continue focusing on the affordable housing market because we believe that this addresses the issue of affordability in the coming years,\u201d he said.When asked about the total investment of the development, Lee said: \u201cif we are talking about just the land cost itself, then it is about RM500mil. Additionally, there will be another 20% of consulting services and fees that we have to pay\u201d.Projected to span a 10-year development period, SkyWorld is expected to generate a total gross development value worth RM13bil from the entire project.Lee shared that the group incorporates a specific analysis practice when it comes to developing its affordable housing projects.This includes the cross ventilation analysis as well as daylight analysis.According to him, by analysing specific factors and ensuring that certain criteria are met, it allows SkyWorld to build the affordable developments that it has today.\u201cA main issue for homebuyers when it comes to high-rise properties are the expensive maintenance costs. By ensuring that our development provides sufficient sunlight and proper ventilation, we can actually cut down on maintenance costs.\u201cLike other developments, this analysis will also be incorporated into our new project in Penang as well,\u201d he said.Lee added that SkyWorld will also be introducing industrialised building system (IBS) 3D-prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC) technology, of which the group will be collaborating with an international IBS technology manufacturer to develop the project in Penang.Despite not disclosing further on the partnership, he said the application of IBS 3D-PPVC technology will increase development quality and reduce delivery time.\u201cThis will also be the first for the technology to be applied in a development in Malaysia,\u201d he said.Lee then highlighted the location of the development, which he considered \u201cfits perfectly\u201d in the prime location in Penang\u2019s economical landscape.Known as a hot spot for electrical and electronics international players, Lee said the project also opens opportunities for young and skilled workers to buy houses.\u201cPeople have been going to Bayan Lepas and I think that location is already too packed. So for this new location, I believe this is a very convenient step for homebuyers to be close to their workplace and still enjoy a comfortable and healthy lifestyle,\u201d he said.SkyWorld made its entry into the affordable housing scene back in 2014 following the successful launch of its first affordable home series in Sentul, SkyAwani 1.This was followed by the launch of four additional developments under the SkyAwani Series, as well as its latest Perumahan Rakyat 1Malaysia (PR1MA) development announced in August 2024.Additionally, Lee stated that SkyWorld is confident in its ability to proceed with less than 40 days of approval in terms of project documentation and submissions.\u201cIf you ask me whether we can cut down the timeline to less than 40 days, we are confident, especially with the help of all parties. Whether it\u2019s discussing with the government, the private sectors, or local authorities \u2013 we have to work together in order to get things done\u201d.The statement comes following Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s call-to-action for property developers to increase the efficiency and completion of affordable housing projects. He stated during a speech that \u201cthere should be no reason to delay such projects when proper documentation and submissions have been made\u201d.\u201cI had the experience of a groundbreaking ceremony of an affordable housing development in Kuala Lumpur that took place within 45 days after the joint development agreement was signed. This showed how efficiency can make things possible. If it can be done in Kuala Lumpur, I\u2019m sure Penang can, too,\u201d Anwar said.The signing ceremony was also witnessed by Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming, Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, PDC chief executive Datuk Aziz Bakar, PDC Properties chief executive Ismail Ishak and SkyWorld founder and executive chairman Datuk Seri Ng Thien Ping.During his speech, Nga said the Rumah Bakat Baru Madani project aligned with the Madani pillars of sustainability and harmony.\u201cI always emphasise that affordable housing is not only to meet the needs of current demands, but also the future. It should not just be livable, but must also be loved,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Chow highlighted the significance of this development within the state\u2019s Penang2030 vision, which prioritises liveability and socioeconomic growth.\u201cThe Rumah Bakat Baru Madani concept is a game-changer. It offers opportunities for both Penangites and non-Penangites working here to own homes, ensuring inclusivity and equity in housing,\u201d he said.This is in line with addressing the heightened demand for affordable homes following the state\u2019s economy, which continues to attract domestic and international investments as well as talents.",

While pursuing economic growth, we must ensure development remains humane.\u201cFor instance, if high-end homes have premium facilities, affordable housing should at least offer amenities like pools and playgrounds. \u201cWe aim to provide the best facilities possible so that people feel included and valued by the nation.\u201dOn the project at hand, Anwar expressed hope that the Penang government and developers would complete the approval process within 45 days.Rumah Bakat Baru Madani is set to be the largest affordable housing development project in Malaysia\u2019s history, with more than 35,000 units to be built for the B40 and M40 groups.It is jointly developed by SkyWorld Development Bhd and Penang Development Corporation (PDC) with the latter\u2019s subsidiary, PDC Properties.Located on two plots of prime land on the mainland \u2013 13ha in Seberang Jaya and 65.3ha in Batu Kawan \u2013 the project will deliver over 35,000 affordable housing and Rumah Bakat Baru Madani units, priced between RM225,000 and RM420,000, with the entire construction timeline expected to take 15 years.Seberang Jaya and Batu Kawan are vital to Penang\u2019s economy, especially in the electrical and electronics sector, with increasing demand and growth potential.Among those present at the signing ceremony were Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming, Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, PDC chief executive officer Datuk Aziz Bakar, PDC Properties chief executive officer Ismail Ishak, SkyWorld Development executive chairman Datuk Seri Ng Thien Phing and its chief executive officer Lee Chee Seng.In his speech, Chow said Penang\u2019s rapid economic growth has led to increased job opportunities and a rise in housing demand.\u201cIn response, the Penang2030 vision aims to enhance liveability and quality of life, targeting 220,000 affordable housing units, 22,000 rent-to-own units and benefiting 3,000 families through the Urban Regeneration Project by 2030.\u201cSo far, 170,000 affordable housing units have been delivered, with efforts underway to complete the remaining 50,000 homes by 2030,\u201d he said.Describing the Rumah Bakat Baru Madani concept as a game changer, Chow said it offers both Penangites and non-Penangites working there the opportunity to own homes, subsequently ensuring inclusivity and equity in housing.Nga, in his speech, said the project aligns with the Madani pillar of harmony (kesejahteraan).The project, he said, will be a cornerstone of the Federal Government\u2019s 12th Malaysia Plan commitment to deliver 500,000 affordable homes by next year.He also lauded SkyWorld Development\u2019s role in this initiative, adding that such a significant feat deserves a place in the Malaysia Book of Records.\u201cIt is a model for other states to emulate, ensuring quality affordable housing remains a priority,\u201d Nga added.

The strong growth is a reflection of a resilient private consumption and continued private investments.The healthy private investments are the result of an increase in approved direct investments. About RM489.5bil in foreign and domestic funds were committed from the start of 2023 until mid-2024.Explaining further, Lee said Budget 2025 looks to raise the overall income level of low wage earners via measures like the 7%-15% wage increment for civil servants and higher minimum wage to RM1,700 per month.\u201cAdditionally, the expenditure allocation for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), as well as public investment in education, transport, healthcare and broadband and others will help sustain employment.\u201dLee further noted that the trickle-down effects of the government\u2019s policies must be felt by everyone, especially by the targeted groups.\u201cBeyond the cash handouts, the programmes and projects will have a direct impact on the economy and the rakyat through jobs creation,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the government has been pragmatic in their fiscal approach.\u201cGiven time, I think the government should be able to raise the floor.\u201dOn fuel subsidy rationalisation, he said the government has been extremely tactful in order to avoid self-inflicted shocks such as rapid rise in general prices.\u201cWe could see the implementation of rationalisation in diesel subsidies this year and RON95 by the middle of next year.\u201cAt the same time, we could see the allocation for cash handout Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah and Sumbangan Asas Rahmah have been raised from RM10bil in 2024 to RM13bil in 2025.\u201cSo, it's a very delicate balancing act and the government also has indicated the impact via their inflation projection of 2%-3.5% for 2025 from 1.5%-2% in 2024,\u201d he added.Economists believe the impact of the government\u2019s \u201cRaising the Floor\u201d initiatives will be increasingly visible in coming years as the Ekonomi Madani framework is progressively implemented.",

I believe our country can export it to other countries more widely later,\" he said.He told Bernama this after opening and handing over 'Rumah FAST Rakyat Jenis Banjir' made of WPC at Kampung Mengkarak, here on Friday (Oct 11).Sng said the advantages of WPC materials compared to wood are that they are environmentally friendly, affordable, can be used in industrial building systems (IBS), are pre-fabricated and can utilise metal-reinforced technology that provides additional strength to building structures such as houses.This is because WPC is a composite material produced from sawdust, other biomass materials, and thermoplastics such as polyethene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride, he said.\"In addition to being used to make decks of jetties, landscape fences and outdoor furniture, WPC has a vast potential to be used in house construction, especially in locations prone to flooding, because it is waterproof and anti-termite.\"Certainly, this saves millions of ringgits, especially in terms of maintenance, the house construction price is also more reasonable and the period to complete an 800 square-foot house takes only 21 days,\" he said.Meanwhile, Perceptive Profile Sdn Bhd Business Development Executive Andy Lai said his company aims to penetrate the local and foreign markets by focusing more on flood house construction.\"We are already exporting WPC materials to countries such as Thailand, Australia and Indonesia, and most recently, Dubai has also shown interest in buying them from us.\"In the country, we are focusing more on helping states that are often struck by floods such as Sabah, Sarawak and Pahang,\" he said.At the ceremony, Lai handed over the keys to the Fast Rakyat house, the first of its kind to be built using WPC in the country, to the Bera District and Land Office, where it will be used as a community centre.The construction of the house, which includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, and a kitchen, was made possible with the cooperation of various parties, such as Mtib, the Bera District and Land Office, Perceptive Profile Sdn Bhd, and Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). - Bernama      ",

The project is said to be the largest of its kind in the country.The company signed a joint development agreement on Tuesday with the Penang Development Corp and its subsidiary PDC Properties for the development of a 161.5 acre site in Batu Kawan and a 31.3 acre site in Seberang Jaya.The project that is set to commence in 2026 serves as a boost to SkyWorld\u2019s long-term project pipeline.Kenanga Research said the Penang project would also potentially lift SkyWorld\u2019s results for the financial year ending March 31, 2026 (FY26) out of an otherwise lacklustre earnings phase.The research house has an \u201cadd\u201d rating on SkyWorld\u2019s stock with a fair value of RM1.14.Kenanga Research noted that based on SkyWorld\u2019s results for its second quarter of FY25, the group\u2019s project pipeline consists of only four ongoing projects with a total remaining GDV of RM907mil.\u201cWe think that with the group\u2019s operations being predominantly in the Klang Valley and wholly dependent on subcontractors for development, the roll-out of launches during the early phases of the Penang project would be relatively light, before picking up more substantially over the course of its 15-year development period,\u201d the research house said.Meanwhile, Phillip Capital Research has upgrade the stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d with a target price of RM1.10, from RM0.56.In a report, the research house said it was positive as the development is expected to increase the group\u2019s current land bank by three-fold to RM18bil, further strengthening its property development pipeline.\u201cWe tweaked our FY26 to FY27 earnings per share by 1% to 5% to factor in the earnings contribution from the development.

One of PR1MA\u2019s key emphases is to deliver exceptional value to buyers with high-quality homes designed with great liveability.Residents of its projects enjoy the same quality workmanship, leisure amenities, security features and lifestyle concepts as some other pricier developments.Indeed, as of May 2024, some 85% of completed PR1MA projects have gone through Quality Assessment System (QLASSIC) certification, achieving scores as high as 82%.Most are built in prime locations across the country, allowing families a conducive and nurturing environment to grow and thrive.Many are also completed and ready for move-in, offering great value and convenience right off the bat.The project\u2019s excellence and quality have also earned PR1MA coveted accolades, such as the SHEQ Day 2023 award by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) of Malaysia.It underscores the corporation\u2019s unwavering commitment to upholding the esteemed PR1MA brand and making it a benchmark in the affordable housing segment.Amenities such as futsal and basketball courts (above) allow thecommunity to come together and lead a healthy active lifestyle.The development\u2019s modern design.The latest accolade was for Residensi Matang Premier in Sarawak, which won the Malaysia Property AwardTM 2024 by FIABCI-Malaysia in the Affordable Housing Low Rise Category.The accolade is testament to the commitment of everyone in PR1MA to provide quality housing with great value for Malaysians throughout the nation.Quality made affordablePR1MA seeks to set a new standard for urban living by seamlessly blending quality, affordability and accessibility in one of the most sought-after locales in Kuching, Sarawak\u2019s sprawling capital city.Residensi Matang Premier is strategically located in Matang, a peaceful suburb on the outskirts of Kuching.It is one of the pioneer batches of affordable PR1MA housing in the state, constructed by renowned PR1MA appointed contractor Lee Ling Construction & Development Sdn Bhd.The development comprises 448 units of cosy apartments spread across six four-storey blocks, with a range of essential facilities and development features suited to local market preferences.The blocks are equipped with lifts for convenient access and sit on a generous 8.84-acre plot of land surrounded by vast greenery.The development offers residents a modern and sustainable lifestyle through excellent spatial design capitalising on natural ventilation and lighting, which reduces the need for artificial lighting and air-conditioning, hence saving on energy costs.Units come in four configurations \u2013 Types A1 and A3 at 910sq ft with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, and Types B1 and B3 at 978sq ft with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.Spacious floor plans allow homeowners the flexibility of crafting comfortable living spaces in line with modern urban living trends.More importantly, it gives families sufficient space to grow and enjoy quality moments together.All units come with high-quality finishes.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's housing market, and by extension the property sector, remained resilient and stable throughout 2024 supported by brisk demand and new projects, reflecting investor confidence.According to the Malaysian House Price Index, the average home price stood at RM475,126, with a modest 0.4 per cent rise from a year ago, underscoring the market's stability amid global economic uncertainties.Juwai IQI co-founder and group chief executive officer (CEO) Kashif Ansari told Bernama that residential properties played a pivotal role.\"Residential transactions accounted for 50 per cent of the total value and 63 per cent of the volume of all real estate transactions so far this year,\" he said.Optimism among developers was palpable, with over 32,000 new landed and high-rise homes initiated in the third quarter (3Q) - a substantial 50 per cent jump from 2Q.Kashif added that developers are not only starting new projects but also delivering completed houses steadily, ensuring a balance between supply and demand.\u201cThe market maintained a measured pace of growth, signalling confidence and the potential for continued expansion,\u201d he said.The data reflects a year of measured progress for Malaysia\u2019s property market, setting a strong foundation as the sector heads into 2024, Kashif said.\"They delivered nearly 24,000 homes in 3Q 2024, similar to the previous quarter,\" Kashif told Bernama.Juwai IQI expects the housing market to remain relatively stable in 4Q, he said.A predictable market with stable rates and prices makes it easier for consumers to research their purchases, he said.According to National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) data, 3Q 2024 reported slight increases in both volume and value of housing transactions, with 70,520 units recorded (3Q 2023: 68,561 units) worth RM28.74 billion versus RM28.36 billion a year ago.Overall, the property market performance strengthened with the number and transaction value expanding by 3.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively.This comprises 112,305 transactions valued at RM57.31 billion, against 108,993 transactions worth RM57.14 in 3Q 2023.Valuation and Property Services Department (JPPH) Director-General Abdul Razak Yusak said 3Q 2024's improved performance was due to positive growth in transaction numbers in all subsectors.Additionally, the momentum in the unsold complete units, known as overhang properties, eased to 21,968 units valued at RM13.85 billion versus 22,642 units worth RM14.24 billion in 2Q 2024.Despite ongoing global economic challenges, Abdul Razak said several infrastructure projects are expected to catalyse economic growth and stimulate the property market.This includes the Rapid Transit Link (RTS) project in Johor, industrial projects in the northern region, the Pan Borneo Highway in Sabah and Sarawak and the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).Government's Efforts on Affordable HousingTo boost house ownership, the Housing and Local Government Ministry implemented various initiatives, including the Housing Credit Guarantee Scheme, whereby the government guarantees financing up to RM500,000 for first-time homebuyers, targeting those without a fixed income and those from low- to middle-income groups.Additionally, the Home Ownership Campaign 2.0 offers stamp duty exemptions on transfer and financing agreements for first-time buyers of units valued up to RM500,000 until Dec 31, 2025.Its minister Nga Kor Ming reported that a total of 25,903 housing units under the National Housing Corporation (SPNB) were sold as of Sept 30, with young people owning 19,909 units, or 76.9 per cent.He also noted that 44,983 units or 65 per cent of the 69,205 affordable housing units were owned by youths.Additionally, 25,030 of 41,671 units, or 60.1 per cent of affordable PR1MA units were owned by young people, excluding PR1MA joint venture projects.Addressing ChallengesWhile building affordable housing remained a focus for most developers, they said rising costs ranging from a few per cent to 15 per cent from a year ago, and higher financing costs have squeezed margins.The increase is especially significant for earthworks and infrastructure-related materials.Rising transportation and supply chain-related costs have also led to higher development costs. The rise in the sales and service tax (SST) to eight per cent, implemented earlier this year, from six per cent caused further hardships.Property companies navigated a mixed landscape with moderate growth, balancing cost pressures and cautious demand in the residential sector this year while commercial properties showed signs of recovery but face longer-term structural challenges.Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association (Rehda) Malaysia president Datuk Ho Hon Sang said that based on its survey, 84 per cent of respondents were impacted by economic conditions in the first half (1H) of 2024.This prompted them to implement cost-cutting measures which include freezing recruitment, reducing staff benefits and delaying or scaling down project launches.Despite this, Ho said 44 per cent of respondents planned to launch projects in 2H 2024, focusing primarily on landed properties, which continue to see higher demand versus high-rise developments.To boost sales, developers would offer assistance with down payments (covering the first 10 per cent), increase their use of digital marketing and virtual technologies and provide discounts to buyers, averaging eight per cent.Outlook for 2025Ho said developers are more optimistic about 1H 2025's outlook versus 2H 2024, which was driven by carry-forward transactions from the previous year and rising building material costs.Nonetheless, developers are adopting a cautious, wait-and-see approach to assess what lies ahead, following the proposed Urban Redevelopment Act, which may impact the sector positively next year.Another much-awaited change is the amendment to Act 118, which has been announced to be tabled next year by the Housing and Local Government minister.Meanwhile, Juwai IQI's Kashif expects a strong 2025 with manufacturing, technology exports, construction, and services driving consistent growth.Stable interest rates and broad-based growth will position Malaysia for steady progress in 2025, he said.\"Rates are important because when they remain stable, so will borrowing costs for mortgages and development financing. This means that existing loans with floating interest rates will not see significant changes, which is good for household finances and the industry,\" he said.It expects two themes to dominate the residential market in 2025, mixed-use integrated townships, and affordable housing.Large-scale developments combine residential, commercial, retail and recreational spaces, providing access to transportation, shopping, restaurants and parks, making it easier to get to schools and workplaces.As for affordable housing, the government is making a concerted effort to increase and improve supply.According to the Housing and Local Government Ministry, the new Residensi Rakyat Programme (PRR), to be built starting next year, is expected to provide more conducive housing with emphasis on accessibility, connectivity, sustainability, livability and mobility, complete with public facilities.Budget 2025 also saw the Madani Deposit scheme, a reintroduction of the previous MyDeposit Scheme and My First Home Scheme to help first-time house buyers with a RM30,000 deposit.\"Everyone should have access to decent and affordable housing. The government's focus on affordable housing should lead to the construction of more social housing and units priced below RM300,000,\" Kashif added. - Bernama ",

They should have been inspected before being allowed to start operating,\u201d he added.Yee said the three-block PPR contained nine lifts, with each block having three.According to a notice from DBKL at the PPR, a contractor was appointed in December 2023 and the lift replacement work was expected to be completed in May this year.The work was divided into three phases, with each phase seeing one lift from each block being replaced.Yee said progress had been slow and called on DBKL to make sure the contractor finished the work on time.\u201cIt took around eight months to complete the first phase. Can the contractor complete the rest of the work before the deadline?\u201cDBKL should fine the contractor if the deadline is not met,\u201d he said.Yee also urged DBKL to build a jogging track and other sports facilities on a field at the PPR to promote a healthy lifestyle among the residents.\u201cDBKL had not been utilising the space wisely.\u201cThe nearest place for the residents to exercise is Taman Tasik Metropolitan Kepong, which is several kilometres away.\u201cKuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Maimunah Mohd Sharif had pledged to protect green spaces in the city.\u201cWe don\u2019t want this field to be sold for other purposes,\u201d he added.The field currently contains a small playground and a futsal court, with ample space available for additional facilities.Previously, some senior citizens living there had urged DBKL to build a jogging track on the field.DBKL has not responded to StarMetro\u2019s queries regarding the matter as of press time.",

A year later, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it handled issues such as such food access, healthcare and online learning, as well as helped residents reduce stress and difficulties brought on by the health emergency.Today, it continues to grow from strength to strength, five years after it was officially registered, embodying the spirit of this year\u2019s Merdeka theme, Malaysia Madani: Jiwa Merdeka as the movement strives to improve its residents' livelihoods and empower women and children.Perwacom committee members with some of the crocheted, knitted and amigurumi items made by the women at PPR Hicom.Now, Perwacom has 15 to 20 members and four committee members: Chairperson Norizan Mohd Nor, 52, Siti Fatihah, secretary Noor Hayati Ismail, 47, and treasurer Zaidatulnisa Salleh, 40.Norizan says one of the reasons the women of PPR Hicom started the association was to help residents who had lost their income during the pandemic.When companies shut down or halted work during the MCO, many residents who worked at the nearby factories lost their only source of income and couldn't earn a living, she shares.\u201cWe wanted to not just look after our own welfare, but also that of our community,\u201d says the single mother who has six children from the ages of 25 to 11, who earns a living by sending children in the area to, and fetching them from school.Realising that it would be difficult to get anything done on their own, the women decided to band together under the association to apply for aid from the government and various NGOs.Before this, Norizan says, nobody knew about PPR Hicom, and aid usually went elsewhere but rarely to them.Standing on the banks of the Klang River, in front of their apartment building, Noor Hayati points towards an area across the river.\"That's Taman Sri Muda where major floods happened in December 2021. From 7pm on the first day, we already heard cries for help, and even until 4am on the second day, we could still hear their pleas. But sadly, we couldn't reach them because there was no access. We too, were trapped in our homes because of the floodwater, and the only exit to get to the main road was inaccessible due to the flood,\" she recounts.\"We couldn't go out because the lower floors of the PPR, as well as all the vehicles, were submerged. Our area was like an island, surrounded by water, she adds.\"We've gone through tragedies and hardships \u2013 the pandemic, MCO and the Shah Alam flash floods, but through them all, we've learnt, triumphed and came out stronger,\" Noor Hayati adds, as she takes StarLifestyle on a tour of the premises.  Through World Vision's One Goal Malaysia initiative, youth from PPR Hicom learn sportsmanship by playing badminton and participating in tournaments with other communities.After the Covid-19 pandemic, Perwacom continues its efforts.\"Our mission and focus now is to empower women and children,\" shares Noor Hayati. \"Our community has faced many setbacks and gone through the pandemic and flash floods, but we're ready to rise again.\"\"During the pandemic, many of us were affected \u2013 people lost their jobs, had to take on different types of work, lost loved ones and family. Then, when we were hit by the floods, we lost our property \u2013 cars, motorbikes, and other vehicles; homes, furniture and appliances.To help these families, Perwacom offers upskilling opportunities for the women and collaborates with programmes such as Teach for Malaysia and Impian Kencana for the children.The children's programmes, Noor Hayati says, are designed to motivate the young ones to not give up despite the hardships they have faced or are facing, and equip them with new skills.\"Our focus isn't just on formal education, but also informal learning. We look at the physical and mental well-being of our children too.\"We've implemented external programmes such as World Vision's One Goal Malaysia, a movement to empower urban poor children in Malaysia to eat right, play right and live right by leveraging on their love of sports,\" she says.This is Perwacom's second year in this programme and its focus is badminton.PPR Hicom is one of the few PPRs that has a badminton court in its compound and Perwacom organises tournaments in the PPR community for young people to learn about sportsmanship.\"Last year, we had a tournament with PPR Kota Damansara and PPR Lembah Subang. Who knows, in future, perhaps a Malaysian badminton champion may come from the PPR community,\" she adds.  Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim visited PPR Hicom in 2023. Photo: Facebook/Anwar IbrahimIn the association hall, many certificates are displayed, a testament to the PPR Hicom community's capabilities.There are also samples of products the women have made including beadings on shoes, embellishments on clothes, knitted pieces, crocheted items like amigurumi toys and decorations.But the women aren't just skilled workers. They hope to transfer the skills they've learnt to their community at PPR Hicom, as well as other PPR communities such as Perumahan Awam (PA) Sri Selangor and Sri Sarawak in Kuala Lumpur.The group also applied for the Kita Untuk Kita (K2K) grant to fund its women empowerment project in sewing, cooking and baking. The funds were used to purchase equipment and appliances for their small enterprises so these women could earn an income.\u201cFor example, a sewing machine costs RM7,000 and we can't afford it, but we've applied through the grant to purchase it and it's placed here at the community centre for use,\u201d says Noor Hayati, adding that last year, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim visited PPR Hicom and announced additional funding of RM35mil for PPRs in KL and Selangor, and the grants \u2013 some of which are pending approval \u2013 are from this allocation.The K2K programme was launched by Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari in 2021. The government worked together with Think City to help improve the lives of people living in the PPR and the pilot project was at PPR Hicom.Thanks to K2K, Perwacom has implemented several projects. Among them is Program Remaja Cemerlang, a course for youth from the ages of 13 to 17 to motivate them to pursue their goals and fulfil their purpose in life.Zaidatulnisa believes that empowering the next generation is important.\u201cPeople often see children from PPR communities as not smart, always loafing around and delinquents, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Our children have the potential to be just as successful as children from affluent communities. We\u2019ve had children from the PPR attend youth conferences and participate in debates. Whenever there are activities, they\u2019re always at the forefront,\u201d says the mother of three children aged between 16 and one.  Children learning from Adab Youth Garage youth workers at the 'Homework Club' at PPR Hicom.Next to the association hall is the Homework Club, an initiative led by Adab Youth Garage\u2019s Youth Leaders Club (YLC) Hicom and comprises youth from the ages of 13 to 17.Here, children are taught effective learning techniques. They are given tips on how to do homework, study, prepare for their exams and do well in them. This is different from school, which focuses on the formal syllabus.\u201cThis was done at the request of the students themselves; it wasn\u2019t imposed on them by the adults. As parents, it's encouraging to see our children wanting to learn and taking the initiative to apply for the grant and having their classes here,\u201d she says.\u201cFor now, they have classes on learning techniques for three subjects: Bahasa Malaysia, History and Mathematics, from Form One to Five. They focus on one subject per month, with lower secondary on Saturdays, and upper secondary on Sundays,\" Zaidatulnisa says.\"They also have what we call Happy Hour which is experiential learning where the youth explore the world around them, such as going on a trip like to the museum,\" she adds.The 'Homework Club' at PPR Hicom is a facility for the residents' children to learn how to study better and score in their exams, do their homework, and more.Noor Hayati adds that last year was a proud moment for them when one of the residents' child \u2013 Maizatulakma Lisa Aqilah Abdullah \u2013 was selected to participate in Teach for Malaysia's Kids Education Revolution Programme in Mumbai, India.\"There were four youths from Malaysia including from PPR Hicom and they had to take part in a parliamentary style debate with other participants who were college students, teachers and lecturers,\" she says.Then there is the Cooking Project where five participants from PPR Hicom were sent to learn from Akademi Memasak Chef Liza, of reality TV show MasterChef Malaysia.\"After they've taken a course in confectionary and catering, they are certified and can then teach others in the community what they have learnt,\" says Noor Hayati.Training is also provided through the Human Resource Development Council (HRDC). One of its programmes is Program Latihan Madani which empowers Malaysia's underserved communities through learning and development.It runs programmes on food safety and quality, and the certification is recognised by the Health Ministry, she says.Women residents can also take digital marketing courses that teach them how to market the products they make, be it food or handicrafts.Residents of PPR Hicom showcase their talents in the Projek Keceriaan which aims to beautify and invigorate their surroundings.Perwacom's latest project is Projek Keceriaan which is a long-term effort to beautify and enhance the PPR Hicom flats. The purpose is to strengthen community ties, build cooperation and communication among the residents since they have to work together on the project.It's a floor-by-floor project for all three blocks.Through Projek Keceriaan, residents at PPR Hicom build camaraderie and learn to work together to beautify their surroundings.\"Often, even though people live in the same building, they don't know each other. They don't even talk to their neighbours on the same floor. This project encourages them to come out and get to know their neighbours,\" says Noor Hayati.\"They have to clean the corridors together, repaint the walls, meet and discuss how to beautify and decorate the area, so they will get to know each other,\" she adds.\u201cWe want to be a role model and a good example to be emulated by other PPRs, and to educate Malaysian society about the PPR community,\u201d says Siti Fatihah.\u201cPeople often have negative perceptions that those who live in PPR flats are lazy, dirty, uneducated and poor, and that children living in PPR flats have bleak future,\" says Siti Fatihah.\"We want to remove this stigma, and change the mindset of people out there; PPR residents can be successful like any other community. We hope to be seen as a community with a vision,\u201d she concludes.    ",

        "title": "Develop liveable housing schemes to address mental health issues of PPR children, say experts",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Dr Norhayati Mohd Noor has been receiving no less than three stress-related cases a month involving children residing in low-cost high-rise schemes in the Klang Valley, developed under the People\u2019s Housing Programme (PPR), since she started conducting family counselling and psychoeducational programmes 12 years ago.Norhayati, who was also a senior lecturer at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia\u2019s Genius@Pintar Negara Foundation Programme, said the parents who sought her services told her they were worried about their children as they did not want to go to school and were rebellious and also seemed unhappy and withdrawn.Her meetings with the children concerned found that most of them were bogged down by pressure due to their unconducive living environment, cramped living quarters and lack of facilities for sports and recreational activities.\"Most of their parents were not aware their children were feeling stressed because their (parents\u2019) lives were similar too when they were young... for instance, living with large families.\"I concluded, however, they (parents) lacked empathy because the low-cost housing environment they lived in was different then... for example, even though their houses were small, recreational areas were available unlike now where space is limited and there\u2019s no place for children to play,\" she told Bernama.Sharing the case of a 10-year-old boy who lived in a PPR scheme, Norhayati said he was stressed out as his parents and neighbours would scold him each time he and his friends wanted to play a game like football.Since there was no playground or field near the flats they lived in, they had no choice but to play inside their homes or the corridor which angered their neighbours.\"Some PPR schemes are provided with space for recreation but they are usually filled with the adult residents, leaving the children feeling stressed and unhappy.From a psychological point of view, children are naturally inclined to play and have fun which shapes their emotional and social well-being. In fact, studies have shown that children who play less tend to be more vulnerable to mental stress,\" she added.Not comfortableIncidentally, a recent study carried out by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Institute for Health Behavioural Research and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef) revealed that 13.4% of adolescents and children living in PPR schemes in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur had thoughts of suicide and self-harm while over 12.3% experienced mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.The study involved 1,578 children aged between 10 and 17 residing in 37 PPR schemes.Meanwhile, commenting on why PPR children tend to lose interest in school, Norhayati said due to the limited space in their homes they usually don\u2019t have their own table and chair to do their homework or study.Not only that, it could get rather noisy too due to the narrow corridors and thin walls separating the residential units, making it difficult for the children to focus on their schoolwork.\"However, I\u2019ve seen PPR children trying to work hard to achieve good results so that they can get a place in a fully-residential school and get out of their congested homes,\" she said.On the PPR adolescents\u2019 suicidal tendencies, the experienced counsellor said there were various contributing factors among them being their economic state and the financial problems faced by their parents.\"They often feel unhappy and inferior when they compare themselves to their friends whose families are well-off,\" she said.According to Norhayati, there was a marked difference between living in a kampung and PPR scheme. Kampung communities were homogeneous, meaning they share similar social status, whereas PPR residents were heterogeneous as they hailed from different income groups.Consider well-being of PPR childrenDescribing the well-being of PPR residents as an issue that needs to be addressed effectively, she said for children and adolescents, healthy psychological development was crucial in order to produce emotionally, physically and mentally stable human capital.\"It\u2019s not just the mental health issues of the teenagers and children that is worrying us... but its impact on the well-being of the people around them also needs to be considered.\"This is because mental problems don\u2019t just involve individuals and their families. We also have to look at the overall impact as it can destroy a nation,\" she said, adding that people who were happy in their childhood and adolescent years would definitely be psychologically healthy as well.In order to create more liveable PPR schemes, Norhayati saw a need for various government agencies to collaborate to provide the necessary activities, infrastructure and family psychoeducational programmes (to look into financial, education and health aspects) for the residents.She also saw a need for each PPR community to create a team to strengthen ties between the families and residents as well as looked into their well-being.\"They must cooperate to look after their well-being, not just the physical aspect but also psychological.\"They can, for instance, introduce a rule to make it compulsory for the PPR children to return home by 8pm and teenagers by 9pm.\"In Istanbul, Turkiye, there is a PPR-like housing scheme where children are only allowed to be outdoors until 5pm and if they are not home by then, their parents will be penalised,\" she said.She added that the authorities could also fine-tune programmes that were of interest to children living in PPR flats and provide the necessary facilities for them as most of them were from low-income families.Liveable housingMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia Department of Architecture senior lecturer Associate Prof Dr Mohd Zairul Mohd Noor opined that the National Housing Policy must be reviewed to provide for more conducive, comfortable and better quality low-cost housing.This was necessary to ensure public housing schemes were built with the demography and sociocultural needs of the local community in mind and not in accordance with the wishes of developers that only prioritise profits.\"State governments and GLCs (government-linked companies) such as SPNB (Syarikat Perumahan Negara Bhd) and Uda Holdings Bhd are responsible for building low-cost houses.\"There will be problems if a state government is dependent on private developers to build such houses as the latter will only think of making a profit, so there will be shortcomings in terms of the facilities and design of the buildings and landscaping,\" he said, adding that a housing scheme was only deemed complete if it incorporated humanitarian elements and greenery to enable its residents to live in a harmonious and positive environment.Mohd Zairul also said the locations of PPR schemes must be reviewed to ensure they were not built in remote areas bereft of development and facilities.\"PPR residents are mostly from the B40 group and they cannot be marginalised. Our future low-cost housing planning policies need to take note of the residents\u2019 social and economic status as they have the same right as Malaysians from other income groups to improve their quality of life and income.Transit home for youthsTo resolve the overcrowding issue faced by the sandwich generation living in the compact PPR flats - mostly occupied by middle-aged adults who stay with their ageing parents and their own children - Mohd Zairul said the government could consider providing more transit homes for youths to stay before they became financially independent.He said Malaysia currently lacked housing for youths, especially those without a fixed income, so they ended up staying with their parents and younger siblings.\"I once did a study at a flat in Larkin, Johor, where a family with six children stayed. All the children were working but still lived with their parents because they couldn\u2019t afford to rent a house.\"You can imagine how congested their unit was,\" he added.Dr Mohd Hafizal Ishak, a researcher at the Centre of Excellence For Facility Management at the Faculty of Technological and Business Management, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, said low-cost housing schemes had transformed significantly since the 1990s, adding that the schemes now had better infrastructure and facilities compared to those built long ago.\"We can see infrastructure and facilities like garbage collection centres, drainage and sewage systems, children\u2019s playgrounds and security systems including CCTVs at the newer PPR schemes.\"The only thing lacking is the culture of cleanliness and this is where the JMB (joint management body committee), residents associations and local councils can play a more proactive role in educating the residents on the importance of maintaining the cleanliness of their premises,\u201d he said. - Bernama",

Rajendran, Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Maimunah Mohd Sharif and Urbanice Malaysia chief executive officer Norliza Hashim.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: A parliamentary special select committee (PSSC) has drawn up recommendations to the government to ease the rising cost of living issue, with monopolies and cartels said to be among the main reasons behind the increased prices of goods.It also said the minimum wage of RM1,700 should be reviewed on an annual basis, and that the move to have periodical sales of essential items for the low- and middle- income groups is only a temporary relief.Bank Negara Malaysia estimated in 2018 that the living wage in the Klang Valley would be RM2,700.\u201cMalaysia is among the countries with a low cost of living whereby it is still cheap to live in this country.ALSO READ: \u2018Lay down the law to combat rising prices\u2019\u201cHowever, the real problem is that the income per capita is still low,\u201d said the report by the PSSC on Domestic Trade, Entrepreneurship, Cost of Living and Agriculture tabled in the Dewan Rakyat recently.\u201cThe cost of living issue is burdening Malaysians, particularly the lower and middle income earners. Although they are not included in the hardcore poor category, many feel that their income is not enough to cover daily expenses.\u201dIt found that while the government\u2019s initiative to organise events that offer food, clothing and daily essentials at a lower price is not the long-term solution because it does not address the root cause of the problem.According to the report, monopolies and cartels are among the main reasons behind the rising cost of goods.The bodies which were present at the PSSC meetings include the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry, the Statistics Department, Malaysia Co-Operative Societies Commission and Malaysian Inclusive Development and Advancement Institute, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia or Minda-UKM.Minda-UKM director Prof Tan Sri Dr Noor Azlan Ghazali argued that income levels are not catching up with the cost of living.\u201cIf the price and income go up in tandem, we shouldn\u2019t have any issue. The problem, however, is when the two are not the same,\u201d said Noor Azlan who is the director of the Malaysian Inclusive Development and Advancement Institute of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.He stressed on the need to come up with fair prices and higher incomes.\u201cThe goal is not to make it cheap. Many people think that the best the government can do towards alleviating the cost of living is reducing prices, or even better for free. However, it only resolves the problem temporarily,\u201d he added.He also cited examples of prices going up for the right reasons, like fish during monsoon seasons and beef during the Hari Raya celebrations.\u201cIt\u2019s during these times that farmers can get better prices. We want to help the poor and the poor are farmers. But when prices go up, we say control it. That\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he added.Other proposals from the PSSC committee to tackle the cost of living issue include the setting up of a Coop Mart in every Parliamentary constituency,\u201cCooperative movements should be made into a main platform to help the government overcome cost of living issues,\u201d it said. The inflation rate should remain within the 2% and 3.5% range, it added.",

Piarapakaran called on the government to be transparent in the cost of producing electricity so as to ensure only efficient costs are passed on to the tariff.\u201cFor the Regulatory Period 4, the proposed base tariff increase by TNB (Tenaga Nasional Bhd) is about 5sen/kWh, which is higher than previous regulatory periods.\u201cIssues like the Green Electricity Tariff, standby charges for renewable energy plants and direct negotiations must also be addressed to prevent unnecessary costs for businesses and the public,\u201d he said in an interview yesterday.The division between industrial and domestic users also requires careful consideration, said Piarapakaran, who is also the chief executive officer of the Centre for Water and Energy Sustainability.\u201cHistorically, industrial users have borne higher costs, often resulting in increased product prices passed on to consumers.\u201cAbout 80% of electricity generated is consumed by the non-domestic sector.\u201cThis means an increase in electricity costs will impact the cost of living through a complex multi-tier method.\u201cThe government\u2019s policies in responding to that will reflect its ability to minimise cost impact and prevent profiteering.\u201dFor domestic users, Piarapakaran said tiered pricing and rebates for lower consumption can provide some relief.However, he said any increase will still affect households, particularly those in the middle-income bracket.Piarapakaran also clarified the misconception that all domestic users have to pay 14% more for their electricity usage come July 2025.\u201cThe proposed base tariff is an average cost that will require approval from the Energy Commission.\u201cOnce the base tariff is set, tariff bands will be developed to capture the regulated revenue for different consumers (domestic, commercial and industrial),\u201d he said.Piarapakaran also called for mandatory energy-efficiency labelling and a Minimum Energy Performance Standard for appliances.\u201cThe public and businesses must also realise that part of the energy wastage stems from incorrect design principles of premises, such as improper placement or sizing of air conditioners,\u201d he said.As for renewable energy \u2013 solar, hydro and wind \u2013 which is still intermittent now, Piarapakaran said it must be approached gradually to prevent consumers from being overburdened by costs.\u201cIncreasing renewable energy will only heighten the intermittent risk to the grid.\u201cEvery megawatt of renewable energy has a fossil fuel plant on standby, which is a cost to the system and eventually gets passed through to the tariff,\u201d Piarapakaran said.Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations chief executive Saravanan Thambirajah echoed the need for a balanced approach by the government.\u201cInvestments in renewable energy infrastructure such as solar farms are costly, and these costs often reflect in tariffs.\u201cStriking a balance is essential to ensure that consumers are not overburdened by rising costs during this transition,\u201d he said.As the potential removal of RON95 subsidies looms, Saravanan, who is also the Water and Energy Consumer Association of Malaysia president, said more inflationary pressures could exacerbate the situation.\u201cProduction costs will rise, potentially driving inflation, which negates the benefits of the people\u2019s wage adjustments.\u201cMany households may not be prepared for concurrent increases in electricity tariffs and other living costs,\u201d he said.Saravanan said the government must prepare a comprehensive strategy to mitigate these impacts and protect consumers from excessive cost increases.",

The Cost of Living Indicator will help refine both existing programmes and future initiatives for better planning and execution.\"Under Budget 2025, an additional RM700mil has been allocated to the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry to introduce new measures aimed at alleviating the cost of living.\"This allocation allows us to not only enhance current programmes to benefit target groups but also implement more specific initiatives for certain regions,\u201d Armizan said during the question-and-answer session in the Dewan Rakyat on Tuesday (Dec 3).He added that the indicator will ensure future programmes are more focused, addressing basic necessities while empowering citizens to participate more meaningfully in society.Armizan was responding to Datuk Seri Doris Sophia Anak Brodi (GPS-Sri Aman), who asked about alternative initiatives by the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry to support the public alongside existing subsidy programmes.When asked by Abdul Latiff Abdul Rahman (PN-Kuala Krai) about whether the targeted diesel subsidy has led to higher living costs, Armizan clarified that reports indicate otherwise.\"Price trends in various areas show that rising living costs are driven by demand and supply factors, not targeted fuel subsidies.\"Should there be concerns about the targeted diesel subsidy causing price hikes, we encourage stakeholders to report them.

        "content": "CELEBRATED as Kuala Lumpur\u2019s flagship redevelopment success, 1Razak Mansion now finds itself grappling with the steep financial demands of high-rise living. Formerly known as Razak Mansion, the flats are located near Jalan Sungai Besi.The transformative upgrade to 1Razak Mansion brought a 240% increase in maintenance fees, largely for the cost of maintaining modern facilities.Residents like Jagit Singh, 68, remember the lush green spaces and modest RM35 maintenance fees of the original walk-up flats established in the 1960s.After the redevelopment in 2017, the excitement of moving into larger, brand-new units softened the blow of higher maintenance fees, which rose to RM120.Eight years after receiving their keys, residents are witnessing the reality of high-rise maintenance.Among the costly repairs needed are waterproofing, water pump and lift maintenance.The building needs a fresh coat of paint \u2013 an expense the management can\u2019t even afford.Its building management now faces the daunting task of raising funds to keep up with maintenance, which could mean another increase in the fees and sinking fund.Tan\u2019s original cramped one-bedroom flat has been upgraded to a modern three-bedroom unit.Those most affected will be 60% of the property\u2019s residents, who are retirees already burdened by rising living costs.High cost of maintenanceThe looming financial strain for residents raises concerns for future redevelopment projects, prompting questions about whether residents are truly prepared for the higher costs and responsibilities that come with living in modern high-rise condominiums.The government is advancing plans to redevelop ageing areas in Kuala Lumpur, with 139 sites earmarked for transformation under the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040.This effort will be facilitated by the proposed Urban Redevelopment Act (URA), designed to revitalise deteriorating urban areas with ageing infrastructure and buildings.The Housing and Local Government Ministry has proposed a consent threshold of 80% of residents for buildings under 30 years old and 75% for properties over 30 years old.Elderly residents of 1Razak Mansion are grappling with high maintenance fees, which they are unaccustomed to after decades of paying low fees for modest walk-up flats.The URA bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament next year.With this government push, the Act aims to replace many older walk-up flats with modern high-rises, presenting significant challenges for residents accustomed to low maintenance fees.These residents will face sharply higher costs for added facilities and amenities in new developments, necessitating careful management by joint-management bodies (JMB) and management corporations (MC) to ease this financial impact.Not the expected model of urban renewal1Razak Mansion\u2019s Management Corporation chairman Anthony Tan, 34, said the increased maintenance costs were \u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d.Tan said that cost, along with a RM1.4mil debt accumulated from electricity bills, had placed the MC\u2019s accounts in the red.He added that before the redevelopment, the cost of maintaining common areas, including electricity was absorbed by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL).\u201cWe are struggling to keep up with maintaining the facilities and this financial strain is raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the redeveloped 1Razak Mansion.\u201dTan, a second-generation owner of a unit in 1Razak Mansion, is one of hundreds who consented to the redevelopment of the old walk-up flats in 2014.Having been raised in the original cramped one-bedroom flats alongside his parents, the transition to a modern three-bedroom unit with a million-ringgit view \u2013 including the PETRONAS Twin Towers and Menara KL \u2013 was greatly welcomed.\u201cBack in 2017, when we received the keys and moved in, everyone was excited about their bigger units and the view,\u201d Tan recalled, saying how long-term maintenance had not even occurred to them then.\u201cWe\u2019re now facing breakdowns of essential facilities like lifts and firefighting equipment.\u201cThe initial excitement has given way to the reality of maintaining a high-rise with modern amenities and the costs are catching up with us,\u201d Tan said.Elderly residents of 1Razak Mansion want the provision of government facilities like hospitals, a community hall, park and public transit near the development. \u2014 Photos: SAMUEL ONG and CHAN TAK KONG/The Star1Razak Mansion committee member and long-time resident Lee Eng Foo, 58, said to justify the high maintenance fees, there should be essential facilities nearby, such as a government hospital, community hall, park, and accessible LRT or MRT stations for seniors.\u201cThere\u2019s only so much a good view can offer, good development must have all the essential facilities geared towards an ageing population,\u201d said Lee.\u201cYou take away green space, you must return something equally valuable,\u201d said Jagit, reflecting on the importance of preserving quality amenities in urban redevelopment.The original Razak Mansion consisted of 15 blocks in Salak South.The first block was built in 1961, followed by six more blocks in 1963, with the final phase completed in 1967 and inaugurated by then deputy prime minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussein.Over the decades, the flats deteriorated, plagued by leaking pipes, cracked walls and low water pressure.The redevelopment replaced the ageing structures with modern, spacious units featuring enhanced amenities.There was little resistance from the residents and on March 15, 2017, the 557 original owners received keys to their new 1Razak Mansion homes at no cost while 101 long-term tenants had the option to purchase units for RM42,000.For many like Tan, transitioning from a cramped 504 sq ft unit to a 800 sq ft home was a huge relief.When residents moved into the newly redeveloped 1Razak Mansion, the transition period for the developer to hand over the property to the MC was delayed.Under the Strata Management Act 2013 (SMA), this handover should have occurred within one year to allow the MC time to learn the operations of managing flats or condominiums.However, the actual transfer took place in 2019, instead of 2018 as required.By then, the defect liability period during which the developer would have been responsible for addressing defects, had already ended.This left the newly formed MC in a quandary, especially when the committee was composed of older residents who had limited experience with handling the complex responsibilities of property maintenance.Tan explained how after the MC took over in 2019, it didn\u2019t receive any electricity bills.\u201c1Razak Mansion was a special government project, hence the electricity bill was addressed to the Kuala Lumpur mayor and sent to DBKL since no MC had been formed.\u201cResidents were unaware of this arrangement,\u201d he said.From 2019 to 2022, the property\u2019s unpaid electricity bills for 21 months amounted to RM1.4mil with interest, bringing the total to a whopping RM1.6mil, according to Tan.He said while DBKL negotiated with the utility company to eliminate the interest charges and had defrayed the RM1.4mil, it was now incumbent upon the MC to repay City Hall.Now, the MC faces the unenviable task of finding ways to generate revenue.Plans include renting out the community hall and, if possible, a nearby playground.However, Tan acknowledges that these efforts alone may not be enough and a decision to raise maintenance fees appears inevitable.\u201cIt\u2019s a temporary fix. We need long-term solutions to keep 1Razak Mansion sustainable, even if it means asking residents to contribute more,\u201d he said.",

This means that half of people on formal private sector contracts are essentially \u2018working poor\u2019. They have a job, but are still struggling to make ends meet.\u201cAs the cost of living rises, the amount you can buy with your wage, the so-called median \u2018real wage\u2019, has fallen by almost 9%,\u201d said Williams.He explained that the downward pressure on wages is due to higher labour force participation (especially among younger individuals) and the cost of living.\u201cWages are forced down and prices are rising.\u201cAlso, in manufacturing persistently low productivity and manufacturing wages have been falling in real terms since the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201dGoing into 4Q24, Williams said labour market trends should remain steady.In 4Q24, unemployment will be low as usual; underemployment will be high as usual; and wages will barely cover rising prices for most people.\u201dCentre for Market Education chief executive officer Carmelo Ferlito also said he expects a steady labour market in 4Q24.\u201cLooking at the trend and the closeness to the natural rate of unemployment, I do not expect any sensible changes when compared to the current situation.\u201cI believe that in quantitative terms, the market does not require a spur. Eventually, we should look at the mismatch between labour demand and supply, in qualitative terms.\u201dWilliams meanwhile said the labour market is \u201ccorrecting itself.\u201d\u201cThis is because people are moving more into the gig-economy, micro-enterprises, freelancing and side hustles.\u201cThis is because formal employment is a very bad deal with low wages, bad terms and conditions and not enough flexibility.\u201dMeanwhile, UOB senior economist Julia Goh and economist Loke Siew Ting said in a research note that they are maintaining their year-end jobless rate forecasts at 3.2% for 2024 and 3% for 2025.\u201cIn addition to numerous initiatives outlined in the national master plans to boost investments and employment, several measures were also unveiled in the 2025 Budget to reform the domestic labour market to uplift income and expand the talent pool.\u201cNevertheless, those measures are expected to increase business costs amid a more challenging global economic environment next year, which may, in turn, weigh on corporates\u2019 recruitment plan and warrant a close eye on the potential consequences.\u201dThey noted that key external downside risk could potentially be the adverse impact of US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s blanket tariff policy of up to 20% on all countries exporting goods to the United States; and the hefty 60% tariffs on US imports from China.\u201cThis may affect Malaysia\u2019s manufacturing sector the most, which is the second top contributor to the nation\u2019s employment after the services sector.\u201d",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Building on its strong economic performance in 2024, Malaysia is poised to maintain its growth momentum into 2025, with the gross domestic product (GDP) projected to expand by up to 6.0 per cent, said an economist.Despite global uncertainties, economists attributed Malaysia\u2019s positive outlook to strong domestic consumption, key export sectors, sustainability efforts, and its growing role as an investment hub.Juwai IQI global chief economist Shan Saeed opined that Malaysia\u2019s GDP could grow by 5.0 to 6.0 per cent, assuming consumption and investment patterns will remain strong next year, thus driving macroeconomic stability.He applauded the government\u2019s proactive move to boost foreign and domestic direct investments (FDI), with Malaysia fast becoming a regional data centre and technological hub on top of a successful semiconductor ecosystem.\"Domestic confidence of local investors is also very strong, and that is why we are able to attract FDI to the country,\u201d he told Bernama.Private consumption and dynamic private investment collectively contribute over 80 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP.Prof Dr Yeah Kim Leng, senior fellow and director of the Economic Studies Programme at the Jeffrey Cheah Institute on Southeast Asia at Sunway University, said sustained consumer confidence, underpinned by rising incomes, low unemployment, and targeted government income support, will fuel private consumption.\"At the same time, robust private investment, which expanded by an impressive 12.1 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024, is expected to remain a formidable growth driver,\u201d he told Bernama.Yeah said Malaysia is also adopting proactive measures to mitigate external headwinds, including inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions.Meanwhile, Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said continuous expansionary fiscal policies would lead to continuous government expenditure, in addition to private sector spending to boost its productive capacity.\"Full employment status would ensure consumers maintain their positive trajectory in spending growth, although they would be more judicious about their appetite to spend given the elevated cost of living,\u201d he said.Mohd Afzanizam added that externally, a series of interest cuts in many parts of major economies would provide support to global demand, sustaining Malaysia\u2019s export growth.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had forecast Malaysia\u2019s real GDP to grow by 4.8 per cent this year from 4.4 per cent in April while maintaining its projection of 4.4 per cent growth in 2025 unchanged.Globally, the economy is expected to grow by 3.2 per cent in 2025, while ASEAN growth is forecast to be at a robust 4.7 per cent, with the region appearing to have found ways to capture export opportunities generated by Chinese and US tariffs.Earlier this year, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Malaysia\u2019s GDP is on track to grow between 4.8 per cent and 5.3 per cent due to the country\u2019s strong performance.He attributed this to increased household spending.Malaysia\u2019s GDP grew 4.2 per cent, 5.9 per cent and 5.3 per cent in the year\u2019s first, second, and third quarters, respectively.Meanwhile, the country\u2019s GDP growth for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.2 per cent, up from 3.8 per cent in the same period in 2023.The next update for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 GDP is scheduled to be released on February 14, 2025.Meanwhile, economists also see Malaysia\u2019s assumption of the ASEAN chairmanship as a platform to enhance its global standing.Yeah, who is also currently the Malaysian Economic Association (MEA) president, said catalysts include landmark projects such as the Singapore-Johor Special Economic Zone and ongoing expansion in data centres and technology-intensive industries, which are anticipated to attract substantial inflows.\"By deepening engagement in regional trade agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the country is fortifying its market diversification and trade resilience,\u201d he said.Yeah said there will be opportunities to unlock new trade and investment opportunities for Malaysian enterprises while advancing ASEAN\u2019s collective economic interests.\"Malaysia\u2019s stewardship will not only elevate the region\u2019s economic clout but also position the nation as a focal point for global investment,\u201d he said.Nevertheless, Yeah noted that challenges loom, particularly in navigating complex geopolitical terrains such as the Myanmar crisis and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.He underscored the necessity of maintaining ASEAN\u2019s neutrality and cohesion amid intensifying US-China rivalries.\"Malaysia must foster constructive dialogue and consensus to safeguard ASEAN\u2019s unity and prevent fragmentation in the global trading system.\"With ASEAN forecasted to sustain robust annual growth exceeding five per cent, there is confidence in the region\u2019s continued appeal to global investors,\u201d he said.Shan said ASEAN 2025 will have a meaningful economic and financial impact on all the players involved.\"Malaysia will continue to support the ASEAN economic community so that all members are aligned to make the region more resilient and able to emerge as a stronger regional bloc to drive the growth of the global economy,\u201d he said.Shan added that he expects Malaysia to continuously benefit from the movement of global companies, such as the Chinese repositioning or relocating to ASEAN

        "content": "The government\u2019s Madani economy to \u2018raise the floor\u2019 PETALING JAYA: With nearly half-a-trillion ringgit in approved investments secured since 2023 and an economy that outperformed growth forecasts for three straight quarters this year, it is increasingly crucial for Malaysia to ensure the benefits of economic growth trickle down to the entire population.The government\u2019s \u201cRaising the Floor\u201d agenda is, therefore, timely in strengthening the vulnerable segments of the society through education, subsidies and social protection schemes.This progressive agenda, which is one of the key thrusts of Budget 2025, is an extension of the ongoing efforts by the administration of Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to improve the living standards of all Malaysians.A key success of such efforts is the eradication of 65.6% hardcore poverty in the country, as announced in the Parliament on Oct 22.Other efforts as mentioned in Budget 2025 include the 13% hike in minimum wage to RM1,700; measures to boost affordable home ownership such as the Residensi Rakyat Programme; improvements to healthcare; and a matching incentive to encourage informal workers and housewives to build retirement savings.A notable budget announcement was the introduction of targeted subsidies, especially for RON95 petrol.While this means a cut in the government subsidy bill, the targeted approach ensures that 85% of consumers in Malaysia will continue to enjoy the fuel subsidy, helping them to manage the high cost of living.The government aims to undertake these \u201cRaising the Floor\u201d initiatives while slashing the annual budget deficit from RM99.48bil in 2022 to RM79.97bil in 2025.Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Socio-Economic Research Centre, said Budget 2025 measures will sustain the country\u2019s economic growth and investment, further boosting the employment prospects.Malaysia\u2019s gross domestic product grew 4.2% in the first quarter of 2024, followed by 5.9% and 5.3% in the subsequent quarters. The strong growth is a reflection of a resilient private consumption and continued private investments.The healthy private investments are the result of an increase in approved direct investments. About RM489.5bil in foreign and domestic funds were committed from the start of 2023 until mid-2024.Explaining further, Lee said Budget 2025 looks to raise the overall income level of low wage earners via measures like the 7%-15% wage increment for civil servants and higher minimum wage to RM1,700 per month.\u201cAdditionally, the expenditure allocation for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), as well as public investment in education, transport, healthcare and broadband and others will help sustain employment.\u201dLee further noted that the trickle-down effects of the government\u2019s policies must be felt by everyone, especially by the targeted groups.\u201cBeyond the cash handouts, the programmes and projects will have a direct impact on the economy and the rakyat through jobs creation,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the government has been pragmatic in their fiscal approach.\u201cGiven time, I think the government should be able to raise the floor.\u201dOn fuel subsidy rationalisation, he said the government has been extremely tactful in order to avoid self-inflicted shocks such as rapid rise in general prices.\u201cWe could see the implementation of rationalisation in diesel subsidies this year and RON95 by the middle of next year.\u201cAt the same time, we could see the allocation for cash handout Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah and Sumbangan Asas Rahmah have been raised from RM10bil in 2024 to RM13bil in 2025.\u201cSo, it's a very delicate balancing act and the government also has indicated the impact via their inflation projection of 2%-3.5% for 2025 from 1.5%-2% in 2024,\u201d he added.Economists believe the impact of the government\u2019s \u201cRaising the Floor\u201d initiatives will be increasingly visible in coming years as the Ekonomi Madani framework is progressively implemented.",

Discussions are ongoing on the potential reintroduction of the goods and services tax.\"Focus will also be on tax reforms to support small and medium enterprises. The budget could extend reinvestment allowances and raise the Syarikat Jaminan Pembiayaan Perniagaan (SJPP), a government-backed loan guarantee limit, from RM20 million to RM30 million,\" it said.MIER also pointed out that the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 would be crucial for promoting high-value manufacturing, automation and green technologies.\"The budget is expected to target sectors such as semiconductors, automotive, and renewable energy, aiming to create high-value jobs and drive sustainable growth,\" it noted.To boost self-sufficiency, MIER said the budget will likely focus on the agro-food industry, with investments in sustainable agriculture, supply chain enhancements, and climate change mitigation strategies.Furthermore, the budget is expected to prioritise automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and digitalisation, with government support directed toward high-value industries such as startups, tech innovation, solar panel development, and electric vehicle infrastructure-positioning Malaysia as a regional leader under the MADANI economy framework, it added. - Bernama  ",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Malay sentiment towards the unity government, a voting bloc that Pakatan Harapan has always struggled with, has improved in the administration\u2019s second year in office, according to annual survey data from think tank Merdeka Center.In the latest survey, 36% of Malays felt that the country was going in the right direction, compared to 55% who did not think so.In 2023, 23% of Malay respondents felt that the country was going in the right direction versus 67% who felt it was not.Merdeka Center executive director Ibrahim Suffian said although sentiment from Malay voters is improving, a majority of them still held a negative view of the government.\u201cThe positive sentiment is not overwhelming because cost of living is still high and people are still worried about the economy.\u201cIt is just that more people are cautiously hopeful that things will get better in 2025. But there are still those who are doubtful that the economy will improve,\u201d he said, explaining the factors behind the improved Malay sentiment.On the first anniversary of the first Pakatan government in July 2019, 31% of Malay respondents felt that the country was moving in the right direction versus 46% who did not think so.Sentiment towards the government can be gleaned from how many respondents of an ethnic group felt that \u201cMalaysia was going in the right or wrong direction\u201d.Ibrahim said how respondents felt about \u201cthe direction of country\u201d mirrors their feelings towards the current government.\u201cIt reflects how people feel about the government\u2019s stewardship, how it is tackling economic challenges such as cost of living and growing the economy, and the quality of its services to the people,\u201d Ibrahim said when contacted.The unity government is made up of Pakatan parties, Barisan Nasional, as well as parties and groupings from Sarawak and Sabah.Another factor for the improving Malay sentiment towards the government is the fact that they have been politically stable despite persistent chatter that the administration could collapse, said Ibrahim.\u201cIn the unity government\u2019s first term, there was uncertainty on whether they can serve until the end of their term and whether the Opposition will attempt another change like in 2020,\u201d he added.Ibrahim said the government\u2019s ability to stay together in its second year and the improving economic climate added to the positive sentiment among Malay respondents.In October 2022, just before the 15th General Election, 22% of Malay respondents in the think tank\u2019s survey of that year felt that the country was \u201cgoing the right direction\u201d.Between March 2020 and October 2022, the nation was then governed by an alliance of mostly Malay parties from Perikatan Nasional and Barisan Nasional.Surveys carried out in August 2020 and April 2021 showed that a majority of Malay respondents were positive towards the government of Perikatan and Barisan, where 72% and 54% respectively said the nation was moving in the right direction.In October 2022, under the same administration, Merdeka Center\u2019s survey found that only 22% of Malay respondents felt that the country was going in the right direction.Going forward, Ibrahim said the unity government needed to expedite how investment commitments are translated into jobs and income opportunities in order to improve support from the Malay community.",

It\u2019s not about following others. It\u2019s about you,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, Ooi attributes the improvement in the overhang unit number to a collaborative effort between the government and developers, exercising caution in approving and initiating new developments. Regardless, he emphasised the importance of meticulous planning, research and design when undertaking residential projects.\u201cThe location factor includes consideration of daily amenities nearby (schools, shops, train and bus stops, etc). There is also the demand factor \u2013 are there jobs nearby which would then create the housing demand?\u201cAre the residential properties priced right for the surrounding catchment, or is the developer confident of creating a catchment? All these considerations are necessary before a residential project takes off,\u201d he said.Chan acknowledged government incentives are always a boon for the property market. She advocates for a primary focus on prioritising incentives for first-time homebuyers, whether in the primary or secondary market when the government introduces policies and initiatives.",

        "content": "CLICK TO ENLARGEPETALING JAYA: Industry experts are urging the new unity government to reintroduce the home ownership campaign (HOC) and refine the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) programme to drive Malaysia\u2019s real estate market in 2023.Glomac Bhd group managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Fateh Iskandar Mohamed Mansor said there were no catalysts for the property market under the revised Budget 2023 that was tabled last Friday.Fateh Iskandar, who believes that the Malaysian property industry has been facing headwinds since 2016, said the government should relook at the HOC for both the primary and secondary residential markets.\u201cApart from that, the government should work on a more consistent and aggressive MM2H programme to attract more foreign investors,\u201d he said during The 2023 Malaysian Housing and Property Summit titled Reimagining Development in the Post Pandemic Era, yesterday.Under the HOC initiative, first-time homebuyers were able to enjoy full stamp duty exemptions for residential properties up to RM1mil and partial stamp duty exemptions for those priced between RM1mil to RM2.5mil.Additionally, every homebuyer was able to enjoy a 10% discount off the property purchasing price.Meanwhile, Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry (Motac) deputy secretary general (tourism) Datuk Mohd Zamri Mat Zain noted that before the pandemic, Malaysia\u2019s tourism industry had been growing steadily over the years.\u201cThe industry employed about 3.5 million people in 2019 and contributed RM240.2bil or 15.9% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product,\u201d he said.Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Malaysian government has continued to invest in the tourism sector, recognising its importance to the national economy, he added.\u201cSince the reopening of our borders on April 1, 2022, Malaysia has successfully welcomed a total of 10.1 million foreign tourists, generating RM28.2bil in tourism receipts in 2022,\u201d Mohd Zamri pointed out.Looking ahead, Motac believes that Malaysia is able to attract 16.1 million foreign tourists this year, which could bring in RM49.2bil in tourism revenue for the country.This will be supported by the fact that the country is currently in a phase of recovery and stability, as well as the resumption of international cross-border travel and China\u2019s reopening of the border.\u201cIn order to accommodate the increasing number of visitors, tourism infrastructure like hotels, resorts and entertainment venues will need to be increased, which creates a big potential for property developers,\u201d Mohd Zamri highlighted.\u201cThis presents a significant opportunity for property developers to invest in the development of hotels, resorts and other tourism-related infrastructure,\u201d he added.Mohd Zamri also noted that Malaysia has a range of tourist attractions, from pristine beaches and tropical rainforests to bustling cities and historic landmarks.He hopes property developers can leverage these attractions to create world-class tourist destinations that offer an unforgettable experience for visitors.According to Mohd Zamri, the Malaysian government has put in place a number of policies to encourage international investment in the country\u2019s real estate sector.",

The first access card will be for the gated community entrance, and the second for the elevator. If they make their payments, they will receive the access card,\" he said.\"They may think paying is unnecessary, but this is essential to ensure everyone cooperates as a community where we can live in peace, harmony, and mutual respect,\" he said.

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: With the surging cost of living in the Klang Valley, interest groups say improving the public transport system is important to help people cope with their transport expenses.They said that expanding affordable housing near transit hubs, improving service reliability, and addressing last-mile challenges would be crucial in reducing urban poverty.\u201cThe lack of integrated public transport forces reliance on personal vehicles, raising commuting costs significantly,\u201d said Federation of Malaysian Consumers Association (Fomca) vice-president Datuk Indrani Thuraisingham.The Klang Valley, which is Malaysia\u2019s economic and administrative hub, attracts businesses, industries, and work opportunities, she said.\u201cThis creates a demand for housing, goods, and services, which inflates prices,\u201d she said in an interview yesterday.Despite expansions in the MRT, LRT, and BRT, Indrani said poor last-mile connectivity had led to a reliance on costly transport alternatives.\u201cFomca recommends integrated transit solutions with seamless connections between modes like buses, trains, and last-mile options like e-scooters, bicycles, and shuttle services.\u201cIntroduce affordable fare options and develop a centralised app for real-time transit information to boost public transport use,\u201d she said.To address rising costs in the Klang Valley, Indrani suggested expanding affordable housing by using underutilised public land, supporting rent-to-own schemes, and implementing rent control.She called for transit-oriented development (TOD) to reduce car reliance and inmpovements in public transport, including enhanced last-mile connectivity and subsidised commuter passes.Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology\u2019s Centre for Business and Policy Research chairman Dr Foo Lee Peng agreed that more should be done to reduce urban poverty amid rising living costs in the Klang Valley.\u201cSocial programmes need wider reach, and public transport enhancements \u2013 such as MRT and LRT extensions \u2013 must address last-mile connectivity to improve accessibility for the urban poor.\u201cAlso, targeted skills training in high-demand sectors is essential for economic empowerment.\u201cDespite promising initiatives, delays and infrastructure gaps hinder their impact, necessitating stronger coordination and long-term planning for affordable housing and TOD,\u201d she said.Foo said the higher living costs in the Klang Valley were due to limited land which increases property prices, while poor public transport necessitates costly car ownership.\u201cTo mitigate expenses, individuals can enhance financial literacy using tools like the Belanjawanku guide, adopt cost-saving practices like carpooling, and explore affordable housing options.\u201dAt the government level, Foo said the authorities can address these issues by expanding transparent public housing, improving transport infrastructure with better last-mile connectivity, and providing targeted subsidies for essentials.\u201cCoupled with subsidies, it can make public transport a viable and cost-effective alternative to car ownership,\u201d she added.Foo noted that efforts to combat urban poverty in the Klang Valley have shown progress, but said they need further improvement.\u201cWhile MRT and LRT expansions have improved public transport, gaps in last-mile connectivity, such as linking train stations to residential areas, continue to limit accessibility for the urban poor.\u201cDespite positive initiatives under the National Transport Policy, delays and inadequate infrastructure reduce their impact.\u201cStronger collaboration among governments, businesses, and communities, along with long-term planning for affordable housing and TOD, is crucial for sustainable improvement,\u201d she said.",

The sustained momentum in approved investments since 2021 is now translating into increased actual and realised investments.\u201cThis aligns with the uptrends in the implementation rate of approved manufacturing investment, rising imports of capital goods, higher banking system loans for industrial buildings and corporate earnings,\u201d it said in a note today.Secondly, Maybank IB anticipates that income-boosting measures in Budget 2025 will drive consumer spending, such as civil service salary and pension reviews involving an additional MYR12.3 billion allocation for emolument and retirement charges in the Federal Government\u2019s operating expenditure.There are also higher cash handouts to lower-income groups, increases, extensions, and enhancements in personal income tax reliefs, and a monthly minimum wage hike to RM1,700 from RM1,500.In a separate note, Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) said the forecast, a tad softer than 2024\u2019s 5.0 per cent is amid a challenging global environment but still within the government\u2019s target range of 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.\u201cThis growth will be underpinned by steady improvement in the labour market, income-boosting measures, continued tourism recovery, and execution of approved investments,\u201d it said.HLIB said inflation is expected to rise to 2.7 per cent year-on-year in 2025 from an estimated 1.9 per cent in 2024, with potential upward pressure hinging on the timing of RON95 subsidy reforms, likely to be introduced in the second half of 2025.\u201cAs the inflation pressure is supply-driven, alongside rising external risks from Trump\u2019s tariff plans, we expect Bank Negara Malaysia will maintain the overnight policy rate at three per cent for 2025,\u201d it said.Global headwinds, including uncertainties surrounding United States (US) trade policies under Trump\u2019s potential return, pose risks to Malaysia\u2019s economy, however, HLIB expects a more targeted approach to tariffs compared to previous blanket measures.On the monetary front, the US Federal Reserve is projected to continue its rate-cutting cycle in 2025, albeit at a softer pace of 50 basis points compared to the previously anticipated 100 basis points.\u201cDespite external headwinds, Malaysia is on a sturdier footing with steady growth, ongoing subsidy reforms, a robust investment pipeline, and a more stable political climate,\u201d it added. - Bernama ",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian economy is exposed to repercussions of a change in the United States trade policy under the Trump administration, especially from the imposition of tariffs.CGS International (CGSI) Research however expects that to be offset by a healthy domestic economy, supported by Putrajaya\u2019s policies on wages and the spillover from robust growth in investment.The research house warned downside risks could emanate from possible demand weakness amid higher taxes and subsidy removals, as well as any negative implications from Trump\u2019s tariff policy on the exports sector.It expects Malaysia\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 4.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2025 from 5.2% this year due to external headwinds.\u201cEncouraging labour market, wage reform measures as well as improvement in tourism related sectors should continue to anchor domestic demand. External demand could face hurdles following Trump\u2019s tariff policy.\u201cHowever, a second wave of supply chain restructuring could boost GDP growth,\u201d CGSI Research stated in its Asean focused economic report.It forecast private consumption growth of 5.7% y-o-y in 2025, driven by labour reforms including several wage hikes as well as the larger cash assistance programme.\u201cWe anticipate an increase in disposable income from the first tranche of civil servant salary hikes in December 2024 and higher minimum wage of RM1,700 (an increase of 13%) starting in February 2025 to boost consumption.In addition, government measures such as the Progressive Wage programme, multi-tier foreign worker levy, pension contribution for foreign workers and higher allocation in training programmes will likely assist in spurring the labour market as well through upskilling and training,\u201d CGSI Research stated.The research outfit expects the country\u2019s gross fixed capital formation to moderate from 11.7% in 2024 to 4.1% y-o-y in 2025, partly due to the high base effect from the robust foreign direct investment growth year-to-date.The United States-Sino trade tensions spillover effect could see Malaysia attract companies interested in expanding outside China ahead of Trump\u2019s upcoming trade policies (China + 1 strategy).Investments could also be driven by government initiatives such as the construction of the Penang Light Rail Transit, which is set to begin in early 2025.The RM120bil five-year GEAR-uP programme (which will see RM120bil channelled directly into the local economy through direct domestic investment) should boost corporate capital spending and infrastructure development.The research house also expects further cuts in the United States Federal Fund rate in 2025 will help the ringgit, assuming interest differentials narrow.The outlook for the local unit would also depend on factors like global economic conditions. CGSI Research forecasts the ringgit to strengthen to 4.25 against the greenback by end of 2025 from about 4.4 at present.\u201cThe US dollar could strengthen amid the flight to safety, given the high uncertainties. However, a narrowing rate differential favouring Malaysia could strengthen the ringgit,\u201d it said.Key downside risks to the forecast include a change in the appetite of government-linked investment companies on repatriation and conversion of foreign currency proceeds.With the Trump presidency presenting risks to trade and investments. CGSI Research expects real exports to moderate by 4.6% y-o-y in 2025 (2024: 9.3%) driven by the growth in the electrical and electronics sector.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Economists are maintaining the general opinion that Malaysia could begin 2025 on a cautious note, casting one eye on the second inauguration of billionaire businessman Donald Trump as US President and the effect his administration will have on domestic growth.Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said navigating \u201cTrump 2.0\u201d would be a task this year and although Asean will likely not be a priority or a direct target, Malaysia could catch some attention as it has been a beneficiary of trade diversion.In a report released yesterday, it said domestically, Malaysia is seeing an investment upcycle wave with non-trade growth engines including tourism, data centres and Asean economic integration as growth supports.In a nutshell, the research unit observed that Malaysia\u2019s third investment upcycle is on-going as sustained investments are feeding into rising actual investments.\u201cIncome-boosting measures unveiled in Budget 2025 will uplift consumer spending, while we expect Bank Negara to keep the overnight policy rate unchanged in 2025.\u201cDomestically, all eyes will be on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, petrol subsidy rationalisation, 13th Malaysia Plan, the National Investment Incentive Framework and the Sabah state elections,\u201d it said.Perhaps not unexpectedly, Maybank IB Research predicted that downside to growth could arise from external uncertainties, in particular the aforementioned Trump 2.0 effect which is a major wildcard for the economic outlook from potential US trade policies and tariff measures.The other areas of interest for the research outfit are domestic secular plays, as it sees positive trends to benefit banks, consumer and tourism.Other areas include state-driven activities, especially in Johor, Sarawak and Penang where sustained investment action could be seen, as it also forecast developments in Sabah, Kedah and Perlis in energy and electric vehicles.The research house also cited investment realisation, where positive effects from technology, construction and industrial properties spread to second order beneficiaries such as consumer, retail and offices; and corporate restructuring with several government-linked companies.Notably, Maybank IB Research is projecting the FBM KLCI to touch 1,740 points by year-end, mainly to be led by the banking sector, while looking at the Malaysian economy to moderate to a growth of 4.9%, compared to the 5.2% it predicted for 2024.Meanwhile, Kenanga Research believes that Malaysia is less exposed in trade imbalances, premised on the suspicion that Trump may use tariffs as a bargaining chip, more than a concrete policy.The securities firm views the move as a step to alleviate trade imbalances and the urgency for Trump to close trade \u201cloopholes\u201d, as seen in the United States stance towards Mexico and Canada.\u201cLooking at trade deficits between the United States and other countries, Malaysia is also more insulated among Asean countries, while Vietnam would be more exposed.\u201cIt would be fiscal and trade policy that could separate the winners and losers for Trump\u2019s second presidential stint,\u201d it said.Summarily, Kenanga Research added that the strength of Malaysia\u2019s position within the region still justifies a top-down approach, as it emphasised that digitalisation and energy-related matters will be key.\u201cMost of the limelight (on Malaysia) could come from warmer ties with Singapore, given the imminent launch of the Special Economic Zone and its details.\u201cWe believe that the outlook of the ringgit would stabilise from here and would end 2025 at 4.45, helping draw attention back to the Malaysian market,\u201d it said.Kenanga Research is slightly more upbeat than Maybank IB Research pertaining to the FBM KLCI, as it is placing a 1,840 year-end target for the local premier index, while reiterating its strong sentiment on the utilities, technology, gloves and renewable energy industries.\u201cSome secular growth sectors are awaiting clarity. We believe as well that while the healthcare sector has structural tailwinds, for now it may be exposed to some overhang, particularly stemming from the diagnosis-related group payment system,\u201d it commented.Among the research house\u2019s top picks for 2025 are Gamuda Bhd, Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and MR DIY Group (M) Bhd, before noting that amid uncertainty, investors may gravitate towards earnings and outlook visibility.",

        "content": "HONG KONG: The Housing and Local Government Ministry is coming up with a new model of public housing named \"Program Residensi Rakyat (PRR)\", says its minister Nga Kor Ming.He said the PRR would be well-integrated, sustainable and liveable, accommodating quality commercial viability, green spaces, community centre and other features.The construction cost of each PRR unit, he said, would also be increased to RM300,000, offering the low-income group quality homes with a piecemeal price.Under the new PRR, a unit costing RM300,000 would be sold at RM60,000.Out of the RM60,000, about RM10,000 to RM15,000 will be set aside for maintenance and sinking funds.\"There will also be a moratorium whereby for 10 years, you cannot sell the PRR unit, as we do not want irresponsible parties to take advantage of our social housing because this is a privilege for you to be afforded a heavy subsidy,\" he told Bernama and The Edge at the Asia Real Estate Leader's (AREL) Study Tour Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China Edition.The study tour was initiated by Rehda Institute, the research and training arm of the Real Estate and Housing Developers\u2019 Association (Rehda) Malaysia, with over 50 delegates visiting many unique sites, covering urban redevelopment and public housing policies and strata laws.The delegates consisted of various stakeholders including architects, surveyors, valuers, researchers, developers, town planners, lawyers, bankers and government authorities.The minimum size for the PRR would be 750 square feet (sq ft) with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.Nga said the ministry would also emphasise connectivity through transit-oriented development (TOD), which is expected to reduce the number of vehicles and car park lots.The PPR will also be integrated with green buildings, making it 30% lower in energy costs compared with standard buildings.\"We are hoping to get an extra budget. Compared with Singapore\u2019s HDB which has an annual budget of SG$30bil, Malaysia's PPR only gets RM550mil, which is too small,\" he said.Meanwhile, Nga also called upon developers especially active members of Rehda and financial institutions to help the government to develop the many ageing buildings in the country especially those that are categorised as unsafe.He added that the common engineering standard benchmark for a building's lifespan is 70 years on average.However, Nga said the situation is still challenging as currently, the consent threshold needs 100% consent.\"Therefore the ministry is proposing a consent threshold between 75% to 80%, depending on the age of the building, and subject to further discussion,\" said the minister adding that the Act also proposed to cover abandoned projects with 51% consent threshold.Nga also stressed that while there would be a lot of opportunities for property developers to explore in the urban redevelopment effort, owners of existing property would be compensated fairly subject to valuation assessment.Besides, the setting up of the urban renewal authority and land tribunal are also in the pipeline to be parked under ministry, he said.\"This will be a fair and balanced legislation. While we are pushing for development, we shall also protect houseowners.\"This is the Madani government, we will ensure a fair solution for both sides (owners and developers),\" he added. - Bernama",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Bathroom and kitchen sanitary ware solutions provider Sorento Capital Bhd aims to raise RM57.4mil from its initial public offering (IPO) as it makes its way to list on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia on Oct 28, 2024. The IPO exercise consists of the issuance of 229 million ordinary shares at a price of 37 sen per share. Upon listing, Sorento is expected to have a market capitalisation of RM318.2mil.Executive director Jayden Loo Jing Kai said the proceeds from the IPO will enable Sorento to strengthen support for its dealers via subsidies.Planned subsidies include those for new or existing dealers that will sell Sorento\u2019s in-house brands exclusively at their stores, enhancing and upgrading selected dealers\u2019 retail stores, as well as subsidies to operate Sorento concept stores which will showcase its higher-end product range exclusively.\u201cWe also plan to recruit around 200 new dealers nationwide over the next three years,\u201d he said in his opening remarks at the launch of Sorento\u2019s prospectus here yesterday.Hence, the group will be allocating about 10.5% of its proceeds, equivalent to RM6mil, for the expansion of its dealer network.When asked whether there were certain criteria when selecting dealers, Loo said Sorento was not selective in expanding its network.\u201cWe want to increase our presence throughout the country. The criteria for dealer recruitment will be based on the market size of specific regions and we will customise our marketing strategies accordingly,\u201d he said. As of today, Sorento has a network of over 600 dealers across Malaysia.The group also has plans to increase its revenue from project-based sales by targeting building segments such as affordable housing, hotels and offices as an initiative to further fuel growth.Loo stated that by increasing project-based sales, it will provide the group with a much larger volume order and amplify its brand visibility within property projects.Following that, Sorento will be utilising RM31.35mil from the proceeds to fund the purchase of product inventory to support sales of both dealers and projects.\u201cThe amount was actually decided based on the growth that we currently have in our orders in terms of projects, deals and expansion. Based on the deals that we have, we need to cater to the demand from our dealers to meet the expectations from the market,\u201d he said.Additionally, a total of RM6mil will be allocated towards branding and promotional marketing \u2013 which Loo said will aid Sorento in enhancing brand recognition and expand the group\u2019s market reach in the industry.The remainder of the proceeds will be allocated for repayment of bank borrowings and estimated listing expenses at RM9mil and RM5mil, respectively. Applications for the public issue portion of the IPO will close on Oct 15, 2024 at 5pm.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Restructuring subsidies is a good first step, but the government must also look at other aspects such as housing and public health in order to help the poor and vulnerable, say experts and consumer groups.There will always be individuals who fall through the cracks and become the hardcore poor, they said, but what is critical is to build a social safety net and support system to \u201ccatch\u201d them.However, they lauded the administration\u2019s concerted focus on ending poverty and aiding low income individuals and families in the 12th Malaysia Plan Mid-Term Review.\u201cThere is a clear commitment from the government to recognise and address these issues,\u201d said sociologist and poverty researcher Dr Denison Jayasooria.\u201cBut it needs a more concerted effort and more organised mechanisms to address the problem in an inclusive way and by bringing all the actions and actors together,\u201d said Denison, who is a former professor at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.The 12MP Mid-Term Review released yesterday outlined the unity government\u2019s measures to aid low income individuals and end hardcore poverty by restructuring how subsidies and aid are distributed.The government will use a central database system called PADU that streamlines all types of government aid that is currently spread out across different agencies and ministries.Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim also said cash transfers and the various programmes under the Payung Rahmah initiative, such as discounted sales of household necessities and budget restaurant menus, will be continued.While the Rahmah programmes have been beneficial, consumer advocate Datuk Paul Selvaraj said there are other factors, such as access to quality healthcare and affordable housing, that can help bring down the cost of living.\u201cFood and daily household goods are one element of the cost of living picture.\u201cThere are also other costs that weigh families down, such as schooling, healthcare and housing. These also need to be tackled,\u201d said Selvaraj, who is deputy president of the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations (Fomca).Another potential financial time bomb is the retirement savings of many working Malaysians that have been hollowed out due to the Covid-19 lockdowns, said Selvaraj.\u201cThis is a future crisis that the government has to absolutely do something about. We have to rebuild our social protections.\u201dEchoing this sentiment, Denison said the problems could be too large for any government to tackle alone.\u201cThe 12MP mentioned that the government wants to work with civil society as charity and faith groups are good at reaching the pockets of poverty that elude the state\u2019s machinery. This is something laudable, and we hope that the civil service takes it seriously and integrates civil society into programmes aimed at the poor,\u201d Dennison said.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Budget 2025, to be tabled on Oct 18, is expected to provide more details on the implementation of RON95 subsidy rationalisation while continuing to promote electric vehicle (EV) adoption, according to CIMB Securities Research.The research house noted that both initiatives could play a significant role in driving total industry volume (TIV) demand in the automotive sector for 2025.\u201cWe do not expect any surprises for the auto sector in the upcoming Budget 2025.\u201cHowever, we anticipate the government to provide more details on RON95 subsidy rationalisation implementation,\u201d it said, adding that this could be a key factor influencing automotive demand in the coming year.CIMB Securities Research expects softer TIV in the last quarter of 2024 (4Q24) due to the government\u2019s plan to rationalise fuel subsidies.However, it highlighted that the introduction of the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Account 3 and salary hikes for civil servants should provide support for new vehicle sales.Meanwhile, the research outfit expects the government to focus on promoting EV adoption in the upcoming Budget 2025.\u201cWe expect the government to continue offering tax reliefs and rebates to individuals and investments in new EV infrastructure,\u201d it noted.These measures could further drive EV growth, in line with the country\u2019s push for greener transportation.In Budget 2024, the government extended personal income tax relief of up to RM2,500 for EV charging equipment until 2027, along with tax deductions for EV rentals.In 2023, hybrid and battery EV sales accounted for 4.8% of the TIV, with 45,000 units sold.The government has set a 15% EV penetration target by 2030, in line with its Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint.Despite the anticipated TIV slowdown for 4Q24, the research house foresees resilient sales momentum in September 2024, driven by new promotional campaigns for Malaysia Day and the launch of new models such as the Proton X70 facelift and Mitsubishi Xpander.While the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA) is forecasting a 4.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in TIV for 2024 to 765,000 units, CIMB Securities Research is even more cautious, projecting a 6% y-o-y drop to 751,000 units.The brokerage cited the absence of sales tax exemptions, potential higher RON95 costs and increased competition from premium EVs and Chinese original equipment manufacturers as key factors.It also noted that the anticipated fuel subsidy rationalisation could add inflationary pressure, further dampening consumer sentiment.Furthermore, it pointed out that the tightening liquidity in the financial sector, reflected in a dip in hire purchase loan approval rates to 58.1% in the first seven months of 2024, may further impact demand.In August 2024, TIV fell 0.8% month-on-month (m-o-m) to 71,162 units, after recording its highest monthly sales year-to-date in July.In contrast, total production volume rose by 5.2% to 73,966 units, driven by a recovery in national brands like Perodua, which saw an 8.5% m-o-m increase in production to 35,241 units.The MAA attributed the TIV decline to weaker commercial vehicle sales, which CIMB Securities Research believes is likely due to the removal of the diesel subsidy in June 2024.Despite these headwinds, the research firm maintains its \u201coverweight\u201d rating on the Malaysian auto sector, citing attractive valuations and dividend yields.The sector\u2019s net profit is expected to decline by 19% y-o-y in 2024, compared to a 25% increase in 2023, driven by lower sales volume and narrowing profit margins amid inflationary pressures.However, the sector trades at 10.1 times 2025 price-to-earnings ratio, below its five-year mean of 12.5 times, and offers potential dividend yields of 6.1% and 6.3% for 2024 and 2025, respectively.",

        "title": "PM outlines five strategies to eradicate poverty in Malaysia",
        "content": "PUTRAJAYA: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has outlined five strategies aimed at eradicating poverty in Malaysia.One key strategy involves using net disposable income as an indicator to identify target groups eligible for poverty relief aid. The Prime Minister explained that this approach would minimise leaks in the system and ensure a fairer distribution of resources.\u201cIt also takes into account basic daily expenditures, including costs for food, clothing, housing, utilities, and transportation, which may vary based on location and household demographics,\u201d he stated in a statement on Monday (Sept 30).As part of the second strategy, Anwar emphasised the need for ongoing fiscal reforms to promote economic sustainability. This includes targeting subsidies and aid specifically towards social support and poverty alleviation programs. He cautioned that sole reliance on government funding could jeopardise the sustainability of these programs and create fiscal strain.Anwar highlighted the importance of innovative approaches, such as social impact funds and public-private partnerships, to enhance funding for poverty relief. \u201cWe encourage donations from various sources, including government-linked companies (GLCs), investment firms and the private sector, to support community-based solutions,\u201d he added.The third strategy focuses on consolidating various data hubs managed by federal ministries and state entities into a Central Database Hub (Padu) by 2025. This centralised system will help determine the eligibility of aid recipients and facilitate data-driven decision-making.\u201cSuccessfully eradicating poverty depends on a consolidated information system. The accuracy and validity of this information are crucial for effectively reaching target groups,\u201d Anwar added.For the fourth strategy, Anwar called for a change in mindset regarding poverty. The fifth strategy will prioritise efforts to eradicate poverty through a behavioural insights approach, which seeks to understand the attitudes and behaviours of target groups when designing poverty alleviation programs.

        "title": "Cost of living in Malaysia rises moderately despite low inflation",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR:  Malaysia's cost of living, as indicated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is on the rise, influenced by global economic uncertainties and domestic policy challenges. However, inflation remains relatively low. In March 2025, Malaysia's inflation rate eased to 1.4 per cent, slightly down from 1.7 per cent in January and 1.5 per cent in February, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM). The CPI rose to 134.1 points in March, compared to 132.2 points in the same month last year. DOSM reported that this year's rising cost of living is primarily driven by price increases in several categories, including food and beverages, accommodation services, personal care, education, and insurance and financial services. Economists suggest that this trend reflects a delicate balancing act between external economic pressures and Malaysia's efforts to stabilise its domestic market. To address the rising cost of living, Dr. Oh Ei Sun, Senior Fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, calls for comprehensive structural reforms to ease the financial burden on citizens. He emphasises the necessity of reducing regulatory burdens by reforming tax and subsidy systems, enhancing public services, and simplifying compliance processes. These measures aim to bolster productivity, foster competition, and fortify economic resilience. Dr Oh said that Malaysia's heavy reliance on imports for essential goods, particularly food and energy, makes local prices susceptible to global market fluctuations. He said that this dependence exposes Malaysia to international price volatility, affecting domestic costs. \u200b Fluctuations in global fuel prices and a weakened ringgit further exacerbate the cost of imported goods, impacting daily expenses, he told Business Times. Retailers and businesses, facing increased operational costs, often pass these expenses onto consumers, contributing to the overall rise in living costs, he said. Dr Oh warns that as worldwide prices increase due to geopolitical concerns, local prices are likely to follow suit. He said that by implementing structural reforms, Malaysia can work towards achieving high-income status and improving the standard of living for its citizens. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has emphasised the importance of continuing structural reforms to achieve high-income status, despite short-term risks such as potential global trade wars and rising geopolitical tensions. The central bank maintains its economic growth forecast for 2025 between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent. It anticipates sustained strong economic activity driven by domestic demand and manageable inflation despite external uncertainties. The World Bank's Economic Outlook for Malaysia indicates a moderation in economic growth to 3.9 per cent in 2025, with headline inflation expected to increase to 2.6 per cent. This reflects several domestic policy reforms amid moderating cost conditions, mainly due to lower commodity prices .\u200b Challenges faced by households According to Dr Oh, food expenses alone can constitute up to 20 per cent of household income, rendering price increases in this sector especially burdensome. He noted that inflation in Malaysia tends to be gradual but persistent, often outpacing wage growth and leading to affordability challenges for many households. \"So when worldwide prices of these rise, local prices rise as well,\" he said. Government measures, such as subsidies, have been implemented to mitigate these challenges. However, fiscal constraints have led to a shift towards targeted subsidies, aiming to reduce expenditure and minimise leakages. Despite these efforts, wage levels have not kept pace with the rising cost of living, with many workers experiencing stagnation despite increased expenses. Additionally, he said that speculative activities in the property market and the phenomenon of price stickiness\u2014where prices remain elevated even after initial hikes\u2014exacerbate the situation. \"Evidently the levels of wage rising are not enough. The cost of living rose manyfold over the past decades, but wages are still stagnating at similar levels to the end of last century,\" Dr Oh said. \"Inflation tends to creep in Malaysia. Although it doesn't spike suddenly, people feel prices of essential goods and services rise steadily, much more than their incomes rise. So it's a question of affordability.\" Dr Oh said the impact is particularly severe on lower-income households, which allocate a larger share of their income to necessities, leaving little room for savings. He emphasised that the levels of wage increases are not sufficient, as the cost of living has risen significantly over past decades, while wages remain relatively stagnant. Dr Oh pointed out that sectors like food and accommodation are experiencing above-average price increases, intensifying the financial strain on these communities. To cope with rising living costs, he advised individuals to reduce non-essential spending, though this approach can diminish quality of life. Economist: Malaysia's inflation rate lowest among Asean nations Putra Business School economic analyst Associate Prof. Dr. Ahmed Razman Abdul Latiff said Malaysia's inflation rate is considered among the lowest compared to other Asean nations. He attributed the rising cost of living to a combination of external factors, such as global economic uncertainties, and internal factors, including domestic policy challenges. External factors like climate change have disrupted agricultural yields, leading to increased food prices, while geopolitical tensions have contributed to supply chain disruptions, further elevating costs. At home, a weaker ringgit has made imports more expensive, affecting the prices of essential goods and services. Dr Razman also observed that domestic factors, including increased material costs and heightened consumer spending, have put upward pressure on prices. He anticipates that the cost of living in Malaysia will continue to rise annually.\u200b Dr Razman emphasised the necessity of long-term solutions, such as monetary system reforms and initiatives to boost income levels, to address the underlying issues contributing to the increasing cost of living.\u200b The government's decision to raise the minimum wage from RM1,500 to RM1,700 in February 2025 aims to improve income levels. However, Dr Razman pointed out that many workers still lack the bargaining power to negotiate better wages, and the increase may not be sufficient to offset the rising cost of living. He highlighted that wages have been increasing gradually on a yearly basis, but such increments among low-level wages are not enough to cover the rising cost of living. \"The rising cost of living not only caused the lower-income households to have very minimal disposable income but also caused some to resort to taking debts to survive,\" he said. Dr Razman noted that the increase in food prices plays a significant role in the overall cost of living in Malaysia, as food costs constitute a substantial portion of the inflation rate calculation.\u200b In response, the government has implemented price controls on basic goods and services, such as rice, cooking oil, and electricity tariffs, to keep inflation in check. Efforts are also underway to rationalise subsidies, focusing on targeted assistance for lower-income groups through programs like Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah (STR) and Sumbangan Asas Rahmah (SARA). Riding the wave Samuel Tan, chief executive officer of Olive Tree Property Consultants, said that imported inflation is a key factor driving the rising cost of living in Malaysia, particularly when the ringgit weakens against the currencies of exporting countries. This causes the prices of imported goods to rise. \"The weakening of the ringgit against foreign currencies contributes to imported inflation, making imported goods more expensive. This has a significant impact on the cost of living in Malaysia, especially for items that rely on foreign sourcing,\" he explained. Tan pointed out that sectors such as housing, food, and transportation have experienced the most significant price increases. Additionally, occasional hikes in utility tariffs further add to the financial strain. Urban areas, such as Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, and Penang, have felt these price increases more sharply than rural areas, he added. \"As the prices of individual components rise, the ripple effect results in higher costs across various sectors. This interconnectedness means that price increases in one area often lead to higher prices in others,\" Tan said. Tan said that as the prices of individual components rise, the ripple effect results in higher costs across various sectors. This interconnection means that increases in one area often lead to price hikes in others. \"The government is working to reduce the cost of doing business by eliminating unnecessary costs and taxes, which ultimately burden consumers. There should be a strong focus on sourcing products and services locally to mitigate the impact of imported inflation. \"For vulnerable groups, such as the poor and marginalised, the government provides cash assistance or vouchers to help offset rising expenses,\" he said. Tan noted that wages have not kept up with the increasing cost of living. \"Wage growth typically follows improvements in productivity and profitability, but not all companies are adjusting wages to align with rising living costs. Some businesses offer Cost of Living Allowances (COLA) for employees transferred to areas with higher living expenses, but this is not consistent across the board. \"Lower-income households, particularly those in the B40 (Bottom 40 per cent) income group, are the hardest hit. This group, with households earning up to RM5,249 per month, benefits from various government subsidies and assistance programmes. \"However, the M40 (Middle 40 per cent) group, which earns between RM5,250 and RM11,819 per month, faces a particular challenge, as they receive fewer subsidies and their income often falls short of meeting rising costs. Greater support for this segment is needed,\" he said. He pointed out that as of 2024, Malaysia has a relatively lower cost of living compared to many other Asean countries. While Malaysia provides a good balance of affordability and quality of life, regional differences in costs\u2014particularly for housing, transportation, food, and healthcare\u2014should be considered when comparing various locations, he said. In terms of steps to be taken to mitigate the effects of rising living costs in Malaysia, Tan said, \"Financial literacy should be taught from an early age, ideally integrated into school curricula, to help individuals plan their finances effectively. As people grow older, they can learn to spend wisely and pursue financial independence by diversifying income sources through side businesses, investments, and savings. Building a savings habit is essential for managing unexpected events and ensuring financial stability.\" Tan added that young Malaysians face challenges in raising the initial deposit for homes due to escalating house prices. While government schemes exist to help bridge the gap, the rising cost of homes is still a barrier for many. Tan said state governments should prioritise the development of affordable housing options, and financing should be made more accessible for qualified individuals. Renting may be a more flexible and realistic option for many until they can afford homeownership, he said.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's full-year inflation is expected to remain at 2.4 per cent year-on-year, but PublicInvest has warned of possible upward pressure. The research house said domestic cost pressures from policy changes such as fuel subsidy cuts, utility rate adjustments and labour-related levies, are being monitored, though their impact on consumer prices appears slower than expected. It noted a slight uptick in core inflation but said overall price trends remain contained. \"On the external front, the introduction of the US Reciprocal Trade Tariff Act, despite the temporary 90-day pause, has reintroduced trade policy uncertainty,\" it said. \"This, combined with continued foreign exchange volatility and fluctuations in global commodity prices, could add to cost-side pressures in the second half of 2025 (2H25). The impact is likely to be uneven across sectors, particularly those sensitive to import costs.\" PublicInvest expects inflation to pick up in 2H25, driven by planned policy moves including the removal of RON95 subsidies, minimum wage hikes and a wider application of the sales and services tax. Further pressure may also come from new cuts to subsidies for essential goods, potential electricity tariff hikes and rising labour costs due to mandatory Employees Provident Fund contributions and the foreign worker levy. \"Industry sentiment suggests mounting concern over the timing of fiscal consolidation efforts, with businesses increasingly calling for a pause in policy measures that may raise operating costs, particularly following the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs. \"A recalibration of the reform schedule could support a more contained inflation environment, especially if heightened global competition results in greater price discounting across import-dependent sectors,\" it said. PublicInvest maintained its forecast for the overnight policy rate at three per cent, adding that monetary policy in 2H25 will depend on how domestic subsidies are adjusted and on further developments in global trade. \"With domestic activity broadly aligning with Bank Negara Malaysia's baseline projections and downside risks to growth remaining, we expect the MPC to adopt a cautious stance and keep the policy rate unchanged in the near term,\" it added.",

        "title": "US to impose new duties on solar imports from Southeast Asia",
        "content": "WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday announced its intention to impose tariffs of up to 3,521 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia, a move aimed at countering alleged Chinese subsidies and dumping in the sector. The tariffs on companies from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam will still need to be ratified at a meeting of the International Trade Commission in June. The decision unveiled Monday comes after anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations filed around a year ago by several US and other solar manufacturers. Those companies took aim at \"unfair practices\" that were said to have weighed on the US domestic solar market, particularly raising concern over Chinese-headquartered companies operating out of the Southeast Asian countries. While Monday's move came after a year-long investigation, it follows on the heels of US President Donald Trump launching blistering trade wars through tariffs around the globe. Trump's tariffs, which have seen the White House impose eyewateringly high levies before suspending some of them to allow for negotiations, are aimed at reducing US trade imbalances. The Commerce Department's statement said the new recommended tariffs on solar cells, however, were taking specific aim at \"transnational subsidies.\" \"In the CVD investigations involving Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, Commerce found that companies in each country were receiving subsidies from the Government of China,\" the statement said, referring to countervailing duty probes. \"These are among the first CVD investigations wherein Commerce has made an affirmative finding that companies received transnational subsidies.\" The case was brought by Hanwha Qcells, First Solar, Convalt Energy and others. For the duties to be finalized, the International Trade Commission has until early June to make a final determination. Among firms targeted were Chinese companies Jinko Solar and Trina Solar. Products from Cambodia are set to face duties of up to 3,521 per cent, according to the Commerce Department. Jinko Solar faced duties of 40 per cent for exports from Malaysia and around 245 percent for goods from Vietnam. Trina Solar in Thailand will see duties of more than 375 per cent, and more than 200 percent for products from Vietnam. If imposed, the new levies will come on top of the blanket 10 per cent levy imposed by Trump since early April on products entering the United States from most trading partners. In 2023, the United States imported US$11.9 billion in solar cells from the countries named in the latest action, according to official data.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Rising food costs and stagnant wages are forcing Malaysia's low-income urban households into unhealthy eating habits, leading to a growing public health crisis of malnutrition and obesity. A recent study by the Social Wellbeing Research Centre (SWRC) at Universiti Malaya found that many struggling families rely on instant noodles, fried foods, and sugary drinks instead of nutritious meals. The study, titled Food Affordability in Malaysia: When Markets and Money Decide What to Eat by Amjad Rabi and Norma Mansor stated that food affordability was a challenge for urban communities, where wages remain low despite government subsidies keeping food prices below global averages. Unlike rural households that may have access to homegrown food, city dwellers must purchase everything they eat, making them especially vulnerable to inflation and economic downturns. The report revealed that many Malaysians could not afford basic nutritious foods such as dairy and fresh produce. \"For instance, while a minimum-wage worker in the Netherlands needs only four minutes of labour to buy one litre of milk, a Malaysian worker must work for 58 minutes to afford the same amount. \"This affordability gap forces many households to substitute unhealthy, calorie-dense alternatives such as instant noodles and fried foods, which are cheaper but nutritionally inadequate. \"This dietary shift contributes to rising malnutrition rates, including both undernutrition and obesity, particularly among urban low-income populations who face limited access to fresh and healthy food.\" A recent Unicef study cited in the report found that nearly half of the surveyed families increased their consumption of instant noodles in 2023, up from 40 per cent during the pandemic. This dietary shift has had severe consequences, particularly for children in low-cost housing areas. The study found that 15 per cent of children under five in these communities are underweight, while 22 per cent experience stunted growth due to a lack of proper nutrition. At the same time, 23 per cent of children in these areas are overweight or obese, highlighting the country's struggle with a dual burden of malnutrition. It added that the phenomenon, known as the \"nutrition transition,\" is becoming a major concern. \" \"Low-income families are being forced into unhealthy eating habits because they simply cannot afford better options. \"We are seeing an increase in diet-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, which will place a heavy burden on Malaysia's healthcare system in the coming decades.\" The situation has worsened with rising inflation, as Malaysia's food price inflation reached 6.8 per cent in 2022, with staple food items such as rice, chicken, and vegetables experiencing sharp price hikes. The study added that urban households, which rely entirely on food markets, are particularly vulnerable to these price fluctuations, as they lack the resilience of rural communities that may have alternative food sources. The report called for urgent policy interventions to address this crisis, including expanding school feeding programmes to ensure children receive at least one nutritious meal per day. The study also urged the government to introduce an automatic minimum wage adjustment system that keeps up with inflation, ensuring that low-income households can afford a balanced diet. Additionally, it recommended strengthening social protection measures, particularly for children and the elderly, to reduce the risk of malnutrition caused by financial hardship.",

        "title": "Five steps to secure Malaysia's healthcare system",
        "content": "LETTERS: Malaysia's struggle with nursing shortages dates back decades. In the early 2000s, the government took significant steps to increase the nursing workforce, largely by boosting the number of nursing graduates. The country has a nurse-to-population ratio of only 3.6 per 1,000 people, far below the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 9.2 per 1,000  (2024). The situation has been exacerbated by a mass exodus of nurses from public healthcare institutions, with many seeking better opportunities abroad. A big factor is the migration of nurses to countries that offer better salaries and working conditions. For example, Singapore offers salaries nearly double that of Malaysia, along with housing allowances and career advancement opportunities. Similarly,  nurses in Saudi Arabia and Dubai earn significantly more, often tax-free. Secondly, public hospitals in Malaysia are frequently overcrowded, forcing many to work long hours, including night shifts, weekends, and public holidays,  without adequate compensation or rest. The recent introduction of a 45-hour work week has not significantly alleviated the pressure on nurses, as understaffing continues to be a major issue. Another factor is the lack of career advancement opportunities within Malaysia's healthcare system. The lack of professional growth discourages nurses from remaining in the public sector, prompting them to seek opportunities elsewhere. In addition, the number of nursing vacancies has steadily increased over the past five years, from 2,106 in 2020 to 6,896 in 2023. Many nurses were initially hired on short-term contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic, but as the crisis subsided, contract renewals were reduced. Without permanent positions, these nurses lacked job security, structured career progression, and benefits such as pensions and housing allowances. To prevent further deterioration of Malaysia's healthcare system, immediate interventions are  necessary: 1. The government must offer competitive salaries and additional benefits. Salary adjustments should reflect the rising cost of living, and incentives such as housing allowances, transport subsidies, and overtime pay should be provided. 2. Hospitals must invest in better infrastructure and access to modern medical equipment and reduce the administrative burden on nurses, especially overworking, and mandated rest periods should be enforced. 3. Allocate more resources for nursing education and create clear career advancement pathways. 4. The Health Ministry should implement policies that encourage nurses to stay in the public sector, such as offering long-term contracts, structured career progression plans, and mentorship programmes. 5. Collaboration between the public and private healthcare sectors is essential to addressing the nursing shortage. The private sector can contribute by funding nursing education, while public hospitals can focus on structured career pathways to retain experienced nurses. Ensuring that Malaysia's nurses are valued, supported and retained is the only way to secure the future of the nation's healthcare system.

The Southeast Asian nation plans to produce its own graphics processing unit chips in the next five to 10 years as demand for artificial intelligence and data centres grows. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said the government will pay Arm for its intellectual property, including seven of its high-end chip design blueprints. The deal will also involve the training of 10,000 engineers in Malaysia, Rafizi told media ahead of the deal's formal announcement. Malaysia hopes the deal with Arm will allow domestic producers to scale up, creating 10 local chip companies with yearly revenue of US$1.5 to US$2 billion each, Rafizi said. The economy ministry and Arm will each have a set of selection criteria for the local companies, given the value of the intellectual property involved and to ensure successful production, Rafizi added. The government will identify local companies with the capabilities and expertise to quickly begin manufacturing. A host of technology giants, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet unit Google, and China's ByteDance, have announced billions of dollars of digital investments in Malaysia since 2023, mostly in cloud services and data centres, powering an infrastructure boom driven by growing AI demand.

        "title": "Proposal to reassess Bumiputera quotas, discounts in property sector",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Quotas and discounts for Bumiputera in the real estate sector should be reviewed to ensure they are more targeted and meet current needs while balancing social justice and market dynamics. This reassessment is seen as necessary to avoid unsold properties, encourage homeownership among those who truly need it, and ensure the policy remains relevant in the country's growing economic and housing ecosystem. Khazanah Research Insititute director Dr Suraya Ismail said the Bumiputera quota in the real estate sector has been a policy tool since the 1970s to ensure more inclusive asset ownership among Bumiputera communities. She added that the primary goal at that time was to ensure neighbourhoods were not dominated by a single race but instead reflected a more balanced ethnic composition. \"However, that was in the 1970s. Today, the discussion is no longer about whether we should continue towards that (ethnic composition), but rather about the challenge of rising property prices. \"I wouldn't describe the situation as a crisis because the original intent of the policy was to offer incentives for people to live in areas they might not want to live in due to cultural factors. Today, we have achieved a better level of social coordination,\" she said. She said this at the 17th Malaysia Real Estate Conference organised by the Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agents and Property Consultants in the Private Sector (PEPS) here yesterday. The New Economic Policy (NEP) implemented in 1971 included a Bumiputera Lot Quota Regulation, where land or property units could only be bought and owned by Bumiputera. The goal of this policy was to increase Bumiputera property ownership in Malaysia. At least 30 per cent of property projects, including housing developments, must be allocated to Bumiputera, whether residential or commercial properties. Bumiputera lots are typically priced 5 to 15 per cent lower than non-Bumiputera lots. Meanwhile, the chairman of the conference, Sulaiman Akhmady Mohd Saheh, said the Bumiputera quota aligns with the NEP, which aims to support communities or segments of society that need assistance. He said the need still exists in certain areas, but there have also been reports from developers stating that the number of unsold properties is high, including Bumiputera quota properties. \"We believe balance is needed in this matter, and it is not an easy task. A balance between social responsibility, economic factors, and free-market principles must be considered. \"The Bumiputera quota system can be refined and adapted to specific scenarios to allow the market to grow, but at the same time, ensure that the communities in need, including low-income groups, are not left behind,\" he said. Sulaiman suggested that the Bumiputera quota approach could be aligned with targeted subsidies for fuel and electricity tariffs, which the government has introduced. He said the rationalisation of subsidies is now receiving attention as it will undoubtedly affect low-income groups. \"If we look at other countries, the subsidies provided are much lower. One of the main problems in our country is the challenges faced by the middle-income group. \"This issue is not just about property prices, but also about how we can increase the income of the people. Therefore, focusing on high-impact sectors is very important,\" he said. CBRE WTW Group advisor Foo Gee Jen said that the Bumiputera quota in real estate appears to benefit the \"super-rich\" more than the target groups in need. He said the quota gives overall discounts regardless of property prices and the buyer's income status, which could lead to price hikes in the real estate market. \"Some institutions have raised the question of why extremely wealthy Bumiputera still receive discounts. If someone can afford to buy a property worth RM1 million, they are no longer considered poor. \"Discounts should be given to those buying homes priced at RM300,000. Why should someone purchasing a property worth RM1 million still get a discount? \"The amount of discount for the wealthy should be redistributed to help more buyers in the lower price range. This mechanism needs to be reviewed so that it can assist more people in need,\" he said.",

        "title": "Analysts predict OPR to stay 3pct this year supported by robust growth outlook",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: THE overnight policy rate (OPR) is expected to remain steady at three per cent throughout 2025, supported by Malaysia's stable inflation and robust growth outlook, according to analysts. RHB Investment Bank Bhd (RHB Research) economist Chin Yee Sian said the Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) decision to keep OPR at three per cent on Wednesday is in line with the firm's in-house view and market expectations. The central bank has kept the OPR at the current level for 10 consecutive Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings since May 2023. Assuming steady economic prospects and manageable inflation pressures, Chin said three key factors will drive OPR behaviour this year. These include Malaysia's economic momentum with growth projected at five per cent and the inflation trajectory with headline inflation to rise by 2.4 per cent and the behaviour of global rates in the foreseeable future, to a lesser extent. He said the inflation trajectory for Malaysia will be influenced by the potential impact of subsidy retargeting measures, the expansion of the sales and service tax (SST), possible demand increases from higher household incomes and fluctuations in global commodity prices. \"At the current OPR level, the monetary policy stance remains supportive of the economy and is consistent with the current assessment of the inflation and growth prospects. \"The MPC would remain vigilant to ongoing developments and ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable economic growth amid price stability,\" he said. Echoing the same sentiment, MIDF Research said OPR was maintained at three per cent this year as the The current setting remains accommodative to sustainable economic growth. The firm said Malaysia's economy will continue to grow, underpinned by both increases in domestic and external demand. \"While we forecast inflation will accelerate this year due to changes on the supply side, such as policy changes and higher costs, we do not expect any change to OPR because underlying price pressures will likely remain under control. \"Nevertheless, BNM has sufficient policy flexibility to adjust monetary policy to counter future economic uncertainties, mainly subject to changes in domestic economic conditions and inflation outlook in Malaysia,\" it said. Therefore, MIDF Research estimates the full-year inflation for 2025 to pick up to 2.8 per cent in 2025, driven by the changes in government policies, such as the subsidy rationalisation efforts by the government. Public Investment Bank Bhd economist Sabrina Edora said the OPR status quo will be unchanged this year as the negative interest rate differential with US rates narrows. However, she also noted that the possibility of the Federal Reserve pausing its rate cuts cannot be ruled out. \"We believe the MPC is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach, seeking further clarity on US trade and tariff policies, upcoming data releases, and domestic policy developments to assess their impact on growth and inflation. \"While US president Donald Trump refrained from imposing immediate tariffs on Day 1, he has reaffirmed that tariffs remain a key priority on his agenda, subsequently announcing tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico effective from Feb 1,\" Sabrina added.",

Its executive chairman Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Abdul Rahman said the market will be driven by the convergence of digitalisation, sustainability, environmental, social and governance awareness and a growing demand for integrated urban living. Abdul Rahim said with continued government support, such as through incentives for affordable housing, investor- friendly policies, as well as green building and tech-driven initiatives, the market is expected to continue regenerating steadily. \"While market challenges remain, the outlook is positive for those who can adapt to the market's evolving needs especially with the promising indicators of late,\" he said at the preview of Rahim and Co Property Market Review 2024/2025 report here, today. The Malaysian property market closed 2024 on a strong note, building on a solid nine month performance marked by increased transactions across all property subsectors. According to the report, the total volume of property transactions rose 6.2 per cent, while the total cumulative value of transactions grew 14.4 per cent. \"This amounted to 311,211 transactions worth RM162.96 billion for the first three quarters of the year. The surge in 2024 exceeded expectations, signalling a potential market acceleration compared to 2023,\" the report said. Despite the increased market activity, Abdul Rahim said buyers' sentiment remains cautious, as many face the challenges of rising costs and sluggish income growth amid affordability concerns. He believes specific market performances vary between different locations, asset classes and pricing brackets. \"As a result, the tone for 2025 is likely to remain \"cautiously optimistic\", influenced by factors such as fuel subsidy and electricity tariff adjustments, along with global uncertainties. \"Nevertheless, demand for well- established areas is expected to remain resilient.

In the office market, the shift towards remote and hybrid work models is transforming office space demand. \"Companies are prioritising flexibility, with offices evolving into collaborative hubs rather than traditional workspaces. \"ESG considerations, along with amenity-rich locations and easy transport access, are key drivers of future demand,\" he added.",

        "title": "Growing TOD demand to spur property market in 2025: Titijaya Land MD",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's property market is expected to improve in 2025 on growing demand for transit-oriented development (TOD) projects and affordable housing projects, according to Titijaya Land Bhd. Group managing director Datuk Lim Poh Yit said the increasing demand for TOD projects are mainly comes from the younger generation of city workers. The tailwind for the TOD segment, Lim added, will be supported by public transport infrastructure projects being developed or planned across Malaysia. This includes the Klang Valley Double Track Phase 2, the East Coast Rail Link, Circle Line MRT 3, Light Rail Transit 3 and Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail. \"By concentrating offices, retail, and residences within the catchment area of transit stations, TOD projects make public transport more attractive and efficient, reducing dependence on personal vehicles and promoting shorter commutes. \"As a result, TOD typically translates into higher productivity and a smaller carbon footprint,\" he said in a statement. He said Titijaya is well-positioned to capitalise on this incredible market opportunity, supported by its mixed-development Riveria City in KL Sentral valued at RM1.5 billion. On affordable housing projects, Lim said buyers are becoming more cautious with their spending amid concerns over rising inflation, subsidy rationalisation and a potential rate hike in 2025. He said the increase in overnight policy rate (OPR) in 2023 resulted in higher monthly mortgage repayments for many Malaysian property buyers. He said those who have taken larger loans, particularly those who obtained floating-rate loans, will be impacted the most by higher OPR rates. \"Prices between RM500,000 and RM700,000 used to be a range that was favoured by local property buyers, but this has changed due to lower-than-expected spending power and higher living expenses. \"As a result, buyers who previously favoured units priced at RM500,000 are now looking for units priced at RM300,000,\" he added. Leveraging on this market trend, Lim said Titijaya's 44-hectare landbank across major Klang Valley cities will support its goal to provide accessible homeownership opportunities that will help create diverse communities, ensuring that quality living spaces are accessible to all.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) is challenging Malaysia's household classification, arguing that only the top 30 per cent of households are truly middle-income or aspirational. KRI's findings contrast with the government's view that the top 60 per cent, made up of Middle 40 (M40) and Top 20 (T20) groups, are middle class. Malaysia has consistently followed the World Bank's demarcation of Bottom 40 (B40)/M40/T20 from the Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) to the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) for almost 15 years from 2006-2020. \"Our findings challenge the existing B40, M40 and T20 classification that reveals discrepancies between income demarcations and actual expenditure patterns,\" it said in a report entitled \"Searching for the 'Poor' and the 'Middle-Class' in Malaysia\" released today. KRI instead classifies households as Bottom 20 per cent (B20),\u00a0 Middle 50 per cent (M50) and Top 30 per cent (T30). KRI said B20 households are focused on meeting basic needs such as food, housing and clothing; M50 are economically unstable households navigating trade-offs between essential and aspirational goods while T30 households demonstrate aspirational consumption patterns indicative of the middle class, but not necessarily \"wealthy\" by global standards. KRI said the M50 group still face trade-offs between basic needs and more aspirational products, with only small differences from the B20 group. Some can afford dining out, send children to tuition, or buy more furniture. However, the M50 is not considered middle class and remains vulnerable. The KRI report comes amid the Economy Ministry's efforts to define and classify the top 15 income group, which will see a reduction in government subsidies.",

        "title": "Beyond the Headlines: Reflecting on Malaysia's transformative year [WATCH]",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: As 2024 draws to a close, Beyond the Headlines revisited the nation's transformative year marked by political stability, economic resilience, and societal shifts. The Unity Government, led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, has navigated a complex landscape, balancing coalition dynamics while addressing pressing national issues. Political Stability and Governance: In this episode to wrap up the year, the government's efforts to foster harmony within its diverse coalition were highlighted by the implementation of the Madani Economy framework. This ambitious initiative aimed to rebuild public trust and drive socio-economic growth, focused on equitable wealth distribution and sustainable development. Economic Challenges and the 2025 Budget: Malaysia's economic narrative in 2024 also revolved around global pressures and domestic initiatives. The 2025 Budget introduced targeted subsidies and income redistribution strategies to address inflationary pressures and the rising cost of living. However, external factors such as China's economic slowdown, global inflation, and the ringgit's volatility presented significant challenges. Business Times News Editor Presenna Nambiar highlighted the government's ability to maintain fiscal stability amidst these hurdles, emphasising the importance of balancing fiscal consolidation with welfare programs. Economist Dr Nungsari Ahmad Radhi added that addressing educational inequality and enhancing social safety nets were crucial steps toward bridging societal divides. Monetary Policy and the Ringgit: The ringgit's performance remained a focal point in 2024, influenced by fluctuating global markets and investor sentiment. While Bank Negara Malaysia implemented monetary policies to stabilise the currency, questions linger about the sufficiency of these measures and the need for greater economic diversification. Social Safety Nets and Inclusivity: Programmes like the Rahmah Cash Aid (STR) provided relief to vulnerable populations, but rising costs in food and housing underscored the need for expanded support. Observers have called for comprehensive measures to enhance affordability and reduce income disparities, which remain critical to fostering national unity. Regional Engagements and Future Opportunities: Participation in agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Belt and Road Initiative presented avenues for growth. Nonetheless, experts caution against over-dependence on these partnerships, advocating for strategic diversification to mitigate risks. Technology and Digital Economy: Government initiatives in tech education and innovation have positioned Malaysia as a burgeoning digital economy hub. Efforts to foster a competitive startup ecosystem and digital workforce were amplified in 2024, but further investments in infrastructure and skills development are necessary to sustain momentum. As Malaysia steps into 2025, the year's developments underscore the nation's resilience and adaptability. The Unity Government's balancing act of governance, economic policy, and social reform sets the stage for continued progress. While challenges remain, the foundations laid in 2024 offer hope for a more inclusive and prosperous Malaysia. Watch the full episode on NST Online's YouTube channel.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's approval rating has increased to 54 per cent in the second year of his administration, marking a four per cent increase, according to a Merdeka Center survey. The research house found that Anwar's efforts to attract foreign investors were particularly well received, followed by his work in enhancing Malaysia's global image, improving the civil service and addressing economic issues. \"At the same time, the federal government's approval rating rose to 51 per cent, up from 46 per cent in November 2023,\" said Merdeka Center. The survey assessed the government's performance based on eight criteria, including fostering economic growth, tackling the rising cost of living, promoting integrity, combating corruption and improving ethnic relations. Respondents showed satisfaction with the government's efforts across most parameters, with approval ratings increasing by between two per cent and 12 per cent. However, satisfaction with efforts to improve ethnic relations remained unchanged at 51 per cent. Conducted between Nov 27 and Dec 10, the survey gathered responses from 1,207 registered voters. The respondents comprised 52 per cent Malays, 29 per cent Chinese, seven per cent Indians, and six per cent each for Muslim Bumiputera and non-Muslim Bumiputera. Merdeka Center said dissatisfaction with the federal government stood at 47 per cent. \"The narrow margin between positive and negative perceptions is largely influenced by ongoing concerns over cost-of-living pressures and apprehensions about upcoming subsidy cuts,\" it added. The survey also found that 53 per cent of respondents believed the country was heading in the wrong direction, though this was a slight improvement of one per cent from the previous year. The main reasons cited for this view were economic challenges, mentioned by 47 per cent of respondents, poor governance by eight per cent, and political instability by seven per cent. Meanwhile, the percentage of voters who felt Malaysia was moving in the right direction increased modestly to 39 per cent, up from 36 per cent in November last year.",

        "title": "Malaysia's inflation rises at slower rate of 1.8% in 2024",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's inflation increased at a slower rate of 1.8 per cent in 2024 versus 2.5 per cent in 2023, with the index points standing at 132.8 in 2024\u00a0against 130.4 recorded in the previous year, said the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM).In a statement today, it said the country's inflation is in line with global inflation, which was recorded at 5.7 per cent in 2024, slower than the 6.6 per cent posted in 2023, citing the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook Database, April 2025.\"Along with the strengthening of the ringgit and the decline in global commodity prices, the government initiatives to regulate the prices of goods and services, as well as subsidies for certain items, to a certain extent, have curbed Malaysia's inflation from rising further,\" it said.Chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin highlighted that inflation for all groups recorded increases in 2024 except for information and communication (-1.5 per cent), and clothing and footwear (-0.3 per cent).\"The slower increase in Malaysia's inflation was driven by the restaurants and accommodation services (3.1 per cent); food and beverages (2.0 per cent); health (1.8 per cent); education (1.5 per cent); transport (1.0 per cent) and furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance group (0.7 per cent).\"Meanwhile, the housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (3.0 per cent); personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services (3.0 per cent); recreation, sports and culture (1.8 per cent); alcoholic beverages and tobacco (0.7 per cent) and insurance and financial services group (0.3 per cent) recorded a higher increase as compared to the previous year,\"\u00a0he said.Mohd Uzir said that inflation for housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels recorded a significant increase, although headline inflation moderated in 2024.This was due to the rise in sewerage services charges by Indah Water Konsortium in January 2024 that offset higher operational costs, he said.\"The increase in this group was also driven by the adjustment of water supply service tariffs by the government through the National Water Services Commission, which involved an average increase of 22 cents per cubic metre for domestic users in Peninsular Malaysia and Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan, effective Feb 1, 2024,\" he added.In the meantime, the chief statistician said a slower increase in inflation of transport was mainly contributed by the subgroup of purchase of vehicles, which moderated to 0.1 per cent in 2024 as compared to 1.4 per cent in the preceding year.However, inflation for the subgroup of operation of personal transport equipment was higher in 2024 at 1.3 per cent (2023: 0.8 per cent) -- attributed to the implementation of targeted diesel subsidies effective June 10, 2024, by the government to control the leakages of subsidised diesel, he noted.Commenting on the inflation at the state level, the chief statistician explained that most states registered a slower increase in inflation, with four states exceeding the national inflation rate of 1.8 per cent in 2024, namely Penang (3.0 per cent), Pahang (2.4 per cent), Sarawak (2.4 per cent) and Selangor (2.1 per cent).\u00a0Meanwhile, Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan recorded the lowest increase at 0.7 per cent.\u00a0\"All states recorded a slower increase in the inflation of the food and beverages group in 2024,\"\u00a0he noted.\u00a0Meanwhile, commenting on inflation in ASEAN countries, Mohd Uzir said the inflation rate ranged from negative 0.4 per cent to 23.1 per cent in 2024, with Lao PDR recording the highest inflation at 23.1 per cent, while Brunei Darussalam recorded the lowest inflation at negative 0.4 per cent.\"Five countries registered an inflation rate higher than Malaysia (1.8 per cent), namely Lao PDR, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia.\"Meanwhile, Cambodia, Thailand and Brunei Darussalam recorded inflation rates lower than Malaysia,\" he added. - Bernama\u00a0",

        "title": "Trump\u2019s tariffs: What is the impact on Malaysia?",
        "content": "BARELY three months since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs from universal baseline tariffs to country-specific tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union, which have sparked retaliatory tariffs.Tariff action and retaliation among major economies have fuelled concerns about a full-blown trade war uncertainty, putting the world stock markets on the edge of extreme volatility.It can severely disrupt global supply chains, increase cost of raw materials and push up consumer inflation, pushing the global economy toward stagflation (low growth and high inflation), and in the worst case, can cause a global recession.China, still reeling from the property slump, faces further economic headwinds from a 34% tariff.The US economy, at the epicentre, will bear the full brunt of the tariff war impact, with the probability of a recession rising to a nearly 50% chance within the next six to 12 months.On April 2, 2025, the Trump administration unveiled the reciprocal tariff plan under the International Emergency Economic Power Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which Trump has dubbed \u201cLiberation Day\u201d, a moment to roll out a set of tariffs on imports from other countries, so as to liberate the United States from a reliance on foreign goods.The US Census Bureau data for 2024 showed that the United States has incurred a trade deficit of US$24.8bil with Malaysia (contributing 2.1% of the US total trade deficit), placing Malaysia on the 14th spot in a \u201cDirty 15\u201d list of nations that accounted for the bulk of trade imbalances with the United States.However, the Statistics Department indicated that Malaysia had recorded a trade surplus of RM72.4bil, showing a discrepancy of US$9bil. Hence, a reconciliation of this statistical discrepancy is necessary to derive the \u201cimplied\u201d tariff rates on Malaysia.It must be noted that the trade deficit is also due to a significant number of US-based semiconductor companies operating in Malaysia for decades, contributing to our role as a major semiconductor exporter to the US.Malaysia is a key player in semiconductor testing and packaging, contributing 13% of global semiconductor testing and packaging and being the world\u2019s sixth-largest semiconductor exporter.Though Malaysia\u2019s average Most-Favored-Nation applied tariff rate was 5.6%; 7.4% for agricultural products and 5.3% for non-agricultural products in 2023, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has derived that Malaysia is currently applying an average of 47% tariff (includes currency manipulation and trade barriers) on the US goods to Malaysia.This has raised eyebrows on the basis of the calculation. Malaysia was removed from the US Treasury Department\u2019s monitoring list for currency manipulation as of November 2024.The United States has hit Malaysia with a 24% tariff on imported goods into the United States with effect from April 9, 2025.It is lower compared to China\u2019s 34% in addition to 20% imposed earlier, Vietnam (46%), Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Taiwan (32%), but higher than Singapore\u2019s 10% and the Philippines (17%).How\u2019s the impact on Malaysia? Malaysia\u2019s external sector will face a daunting challenge ahead, given the disruptive impact of the tariffs on supply chains, global demand and business operational costs.The impacted industries are electrical and electronics (E&E) products (excluding semiconductors), machinery and equipment, optical and scientific equipment, rubber products, furniture products and palm oil.In 2024, the United States was the third largest trading partner of Malaysia, accounting for 11.3% of Malaysia\u2019s total trade (9.5% in 2021-2023; 9% in 2016-2020).It was Malaysia\u2019s second largest export destination (13.2% share); and the United States was Malaysia\u2019s third largest importer (9.2% share). In February 2025, the United States displaced China as Malaysia\u2019s largest export market (14.8% share).More than half of Malaysia\u2019s exports to the United States are electronics and electrical products (54.6%), machinery and equipment (14.5%), optical and scientific equipment (9%), rubber and rubber products (3.9%), furniture products (3.5%), palm oil and palm oil products (1.4%) and plastic and plastic products (1.3%), iron and steel products (1%) and aluminium products (0.8%).Under the reciprocal tariffs, while the E&E products (HS code 85) accounted for 54.6% of total exports to the United States in 2024, the exclusion of semiconductors (RM45.3bil or 22.8% of total exports to the United States) provides a relief to Malaysia and the semiconductor players.Similar exclusions were given to a list of products, including wood products, copper and copper products, energy products, and pharmaceuticals, which collectively recorded RM6bil of exports or 2.8% of total exports to the United States in 2024.Nonetheless, there is a caveat which states that \u201call articles that may be become subject to duties pursuant to future actions under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962\u201d.This means that the threat of industry-specific duties are still lingering and tariffs are not off the table. So, the big question is ultimately where do the tariffs start or end.The United States remains one of the major foreign investors in Malaysia. It ranked second in terms of gross foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2024; fourth largest investor in terms of FDI stock at end-2024.Approved US investment in the manufacturing sector was ranked between second and ninth placing during 2017-2024, with total approved investment ranging between RM1.1bil (ninth placing in 2017) and RM18.1bil (second largest investor in 2023).Overall, the US ranked third in terms of total approved investments with foreign participation in various sectors, recording RM29.7bil or 17.4% of total foreign investment.We draw comfort that the US authorities said that tariffs can be lowered if any trading partner takes significant steps to remedy the non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the US on economic and national security matters. Trump said he would be open to negotiating with other countries about the duties.We welcome the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (Miti)\u2019s stance of not considering retaliatory tariffs, instead will actively engage with the US authorities in addressing the impact of reciprocal tariff.Malaysia will utilise the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to seek reciprocal trade gains and pursue a Technology Safeguards Agreement with the US to facilitate high-tech cooperation in semiconductors, aerospace, and digital economy sectors. We call for a more collaborative approach to address the trade imbalance, emphasizing engagement and seeking reasonable solutions through consultations and joint efforts.In addition to leveraging on existing bilateral and multilateral trade agreements (RCEP, CPTPP and China-ASEAN FTA) to expand trade, the Government has to speed up the Malaysia-European Union Free Trade Agreement negotiation, the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2013 Malaysia Free Trade Agreement, and consider to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the US to soften the impact of tariffs.Malaysia\u2019s small open economy (2024: total trade to GDP ratio of 149.1%; gross exports to GDP ratio of 78.1% and exports share to the US of 13.2%), will inevitably be affected by the US tariffs and global trade tensions via the trade, income, financial and investment channels. Our economy is still highly vulnerable to tariff war shock in major economies as China, the US and EU accounted for a combined exports share of 33.3% in 2024.Overall, the direct and indirect impact of bilateral trade tariffs and global tensions on Malaysia\u2019s export performance is largely dependent on the substitutability of the affected products, reconfiguration of supply chains and production, transshipment and Malaysian firms\u2019 products\u2019 cost and price competitiveness.On the trade channel, higher tariffs reduce the competitiveness of our products in the US market by raising their prices and lowering demand for our products, which decreases their export potential. While Malaysia will enjoy lower tariffs advantages compared to other countries, and benefitting from some trade diversion, global trade tensions are expected to slow down demand and economic growth by disrupting trade flows, raising costs, and impacting supply chains, potentially leading to reduced investment and consumer spending. Companies\u2019 profit margins could be squeezed due to price competition to offset the impact of higher tariffs.On the income channel, lower exports demand would result in lower production, and would impact the employment and income of workers in the export-oriented industries, which will bear the bigger brunt of the tariffs impact. Lower employment and income will weigh on household spending.On the investment channel, firms could adopt a cautious approach to capacity expansion on concerns about the impact of higher tariffs and lower export orders on their profitability. Our estimated private investment growth of 11.5% in 2025 (12.3% in 2024) is revised lower to 10% to reflect investors\u2019 and businesses\u2019 cautious sentiment on the tariff\u2019s impact. The financial volatility induced by global trade tensions and economic slowdown could negatively impact wealth creation.Penciling the tariffs shock in this prevailing moderate global growth and heightened global uncertainty, we have revised lower our 2025\u2019s GDP growth estimate to 4% from 5% previously to reflect the impact of tariffs on exports and its spillover effect on domestic consumption and investment.With exports at risk, domestic demand will continue to anchor growth this year, supported by fiscal and targeted income measures as well as an accommodative interest rate. Appropriate policies are crucial to manage supply, demand and price shocks.Domestic-oriented industries such as services, construction, domestic sales driven manufacturing and agriculture sector will be relatively insulated from the tariffs shock as they apply only to physical exported goods. Nevertheless, weak exports can lead to a negative spillover effect, potentially weighing on business and investor sentiment, which can manifest in reduced spending and investment.Given considerable external uncertainties, any changes in domestic policies pertaining to fuel subsidies rationalization, multi-tier levy and electricity tariffs have to be carefully calibrated to avoid disruptive adjustment to businesses, which have been inundated with increased operational costs.We expect Bank Negara Malaysia will wait to assess the impact of tariffs on economic growth before making any policy decisions, potentially including interest rate adjustments if domestic growth is under threat to below 4% and domestic demand falters.In ensuring Malaysia remains resilient and in better position to benefit and mitigate risks from its trade openness, our industries must continue to move up the value chain, focusing technology and innovation, restrategising suppliers and value chains, diversifying our export products and markets, enhancing investment ecosystem and attracting quality investments that would raise overall economic complexity and create high-value jobs. Malaysia must continue to proactively pursue multilateral and bilateral trade pacts with other economies.Lee Heng Guie is the executive director of the Socio-Economic Research Centre.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Providing subsidies to help strata residences solve their maintenance issues is not feasible, says Nga Kor Ming.The Housing and Local Government Minister said the government's finances are a major factor to consider as there are currently more than 24,385 stratified building schemes under the government.\"The total number of units is exceptionally high, reaching up to 2.83 million units as of today.\"Therefore, if all these houses were to rely entirely on government subsidies, it would not be feasible due to financial constraints faced by any government in the world,\" he said during Minister's Question Time in the Dewan Rakyat on Tuesday (Nov 26).However, Nga noted that the Madani government has allocated nearly RM300mil over the past two years to repair, maintain and rehabilitate dilapidated or structurally weak buildings.Nga was responding to an additional question from Mohd Hasnizan Harun (PN-Hulu Selangor) on whether the government intends to implement a subsidy system for low-cost buildings and methods to solve strata housing problems.Nga said to repair, maintain, and refurbish any buildings found to be dilapidated or in poor condition, the ministry also requires the cooperation of all residents.\"Therefore, under the People's Residency Programme (PRR) set to launch next year, all residents will be issued a two-tier access system. The first access card will be for the gated community entrance, and the second for the elevator. If they make their payments, they will receive the access card,\" he said.\"They may think paying is unnecessary, but this is essential to ensure everyone cooperates as a community where we can live in peace, harmony, and mutual respect,\" he said.

        "title": "Domestic-centric policies to drive market",
        "content": "PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian market is expected to remain strong despite volatility arising from Trump\u2019s policies relating to tariffs.Maybank Investment Bank Research (Maybank IB) said the first quarter of financial year 2025 (1Q25) was turbulent due to this despite the region not being particularly a priority for Trump, nor a direct target.\u201cThe announcement on sector specific tariffs today leaves everything fluid until then,\u201d it noted.In response to that, the Malaysian government is planning to tighten regulations on semiconductors, an important move to preserve Malaysia as a hub to attract investments.On a positive note, the research house said the local market will be driven by domestic-centric policies especially from the consumer sector.According to the research house, it expects firmer spending from various measures that were meant to boost spending overall like cash handouts to lower income families, a hike in salaries for civil servants and a minimum wage hike among others.It added however, even with these measures, consumer companies have yet to feel the impact yet.\u201cEarly signs of momentum pick in 1Q25 was expected given the festivities but we believe there will be more boost, with the full impact of civil servants\u2019 salary hikes and minimum wage increases to be seen from 2Q25,\u201d it noted.The reserch house expected a neutral impact to the sector from the RON95 subsidy rationalisation from sufficient disposable income.Maybank IB also said the state-driven activities like the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) is set to have positive spillover effects into other sectors like property.\u201cThe property sector remains catalytic to further developments of the JS-SEZ with Eco World Development Group Bhd and YTL Power International Bhd (YTLP) as our picks for this theme,\u201d it said.Other projects that will boost other industries include the Rapid Transit System that is to be completed by end-2026.\u201cMoreover, Johor has been identified as a data centre hotspot and investment magnet for foreign investments, so we expect further spillover effects along the supply chain of these sectors would benefit the small and medium enterprises,\u201d Maybank IB said.It added committed investments will remain sound, particularly for data centres, as no significant halts have been noticed so far.However, concerns over tariffs under the Trump administration has caused a downward spiral in names related to data centre plays, construction and to some extent, the property sector.\u201cWe see this as an opportunity to accumulate investments in some of these names given robust fundamentals and outlook. Within this space, we stick to our buys for Gamuda Bhd and YTL Power,\u201d it said.As for companies and its restructuring, Maybank IB said despite not seeing much traction in 1Q25, there are plans to execute multiple restructurings through the year.\u201cThe initial phase of the Gear-Up programme may not have an immediate direct impact on the capital markets but the related positive repercussions and uplifts will be more evident over time,\u201d it said.The research house noted approved and committed investments are unlikely to diverge in its view as more investment realisation takes form.Maybank IB said Malaysia is at the start of an investment upcycle primed by domestic economic policies and initiatives.\u201cTrade diversion and diversification strategies remain a strategic priority for businesses.\u201cGovernment initiatives contained in the National Energy Transition Roadmap are still seeing traction with catalytic projects on track, while the New Industrial Master Plan and National Semiconductor Strategy should set the country on a long-term growth path,\u201d it said.Meanwhile, Maybank IB said there are still opportunities to accumulate stocks for the long-term, including banks.\u201cOur analysis suggests that if investors aim to outperform the market over 10 years, banks are the sector to invest in.\u201cRegardless of the economic cycle, we believe there are always buyers for the banks as the sector is deemed the proxy to the country\u2019s macro performance whilst also being the largest and most liquid set of stocks in trade,\u201d it noted.Its top picks included Public Bank Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Earnings for automotive companies are expected to be softer in the first quarter of the financial year 2025 (1Q25) compared to the previous quarter.However, demand is expected to remain supported by the Hari Raya promotion campaigns and the backlog orders, particularly for popular mass-market models, said Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (BIMB) Securities Research.The significant sales decline among Japanese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) \u2013 Honda, Mazda and Nissan \u2013 by 35% to 52% year-on-year was expected.This decline reflects two key risks in the 2025 outlook \u2013 fuel subsidy cuts and market disruption by Chinese OEMs.The research house expects total industry volume (TIV) to moderate quarter-on-quarter in 1Q25 due to seasonal factors including fewer working days during Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Aidilfitri.The research house maintained its \u201coverweight\u201d stance on the automotive sector, as it believes 2025 TIV is likely to sustain the momentum.It has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on Sime Darby Bhd with a target price (TP) of RM2.60 a share while \u201chold\u201d for MBM Resources Bhd (TP: RM5.50 a share) and Bermaz Auto Bhd (TP: RM1.12 a share).Affin Hwang Investment Bank Research has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the sector, with a 2025 TIV forecast of 720,000. This conservative outlook accounts for sales normalisation from a high base and multiple headwinds in Malaysia\u2019s automotive market.It recommended stock exposure to defensive national plays and economical options, as the RON95 subsidy rationalisation is expected to shift demand toward cost-effective national brands and energy-efficient vehicles, reducing the appeal of petrol-dependent cars.It has \u201chold\u201d calls for both MBM Resources (TP: RM5.44 a share) and Sime Darby (TP: RM2.26 a share), while a \u201csell\u201d for Bermaz Auto (TP: RM1.05 a share).MBM Resources remains its sector top pick due to its resilient earnings profile and limited surprise to downside risk compared to its peers.It benefited from its 22.6% stake in Perodua as the market leader which is well-positioned to benefit from downtrading driven by the RON95 subsidy rationalisation.The strategic addition of Jaecoo further strengthens its portfolio without cannibalising existing sales.The research house stated that Sime Darby\u2019s earnings outlook remains mixed over the near term as a recovery in its China motors segment is likely to face delays amid the ongoing price war, despite showroom closures aimed at cost management.Affin Research added that Bermaz Auto remains its top market sell, as its completely knocked-down lineup faces mounting challenges.Consumer preference is increasingly shifting toward affordability over brand loyalty, significantly impacting sales performance.",

        "content": "IT took him a while to agree to become a minister as Senator Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan is not a politician. However, the call to serve the nation is in his blood, the 57-year-old says: \u201cI think it comes from my father who\u2019s been in the civil service all his life. He passed away while still working as part of the government. So the need to help and do something is in the family DNA.\u201dThe Finance Minister II recently sat down with Sunday Star for an exclusive interview. The following are excerpts from the session.> Do you have a revenue projection from the tax measures announced under Budget 2025?When we were looking at the expansion of the SST [sales and service tax], we were looking north of at least RM5bil.Tax space is one of the areas that we can improve in terms of revenue, and one of the systems we have today is the SST.We have to see how we can enhance revenue collection but also at the same time if we were to do the enhancement of revenue collection, we do not put unnecessary barriers or costs into the system that slow down the economy or place the rakyat in a much more difficult place.When we enhanced the SST, the first round was last year in March, it went up from 6% to 8%. We also expanded a little bit but it was a small expansionIn this year\u2019s [2025] budget, we proposed to expand the range of it, but looking more in terms of business-to-business areas of expansion. This is so that the rakyat is somewhat protected from the effect of what we are putting in place, and it generates revenue to enhance the fiscal balance of the government.Fiscal balance is important because if we have fiscal balance then we can start investing in the right things that the economy and rakyat need.> The government has repeatedly said it will not bring back the goods and services tax (GST), but MPs have repeatedly called \u2013 and keep calling \u2013 for its revival. Is it correct to say the government will never bring back the GST?I don\u2019t think the Prime Minister has actually said that the GST will never come back. What he said is it is not an appropriate time to revive it. We have other tools to make things work, for one the SST scheme can be expanded to achieve what we need at this point in time.The SST has been around for more than 40 years and its familiarity makes things much easier \u2013 reintroducing the GST means educating the whole system. On practical grounds, with the SST we can expand because it is just a small expansion every time, the gazettement and all are easy to administratively manage.But the GST means we have to go back again and reinstall the whole system. Industries must be coached on how to do it, they must install new IT systems. It is not just a matter of turning on and off again. And there are new industries built when GST was not in. The lag time to that, we estimate between 18 months and 24 months.To bring back fiscal balance, and to have the right tools in place, we need to do something now. The expansion of SST is the right form.> When can we expect the mechanism for RON95 fuel subsidies to be fully rolled out?The government wants to make sure whatever it installs is something that is well thought through and that there are no unintended consequences.We are taking our time to test the system well, make sure the data we have gained and refined is actually giving the right things. So I must appeal for time to be given to do the right thing.We understand every time when there\u2019s a new thing coming in, there will be unfamiliarity in the early stages, there will be noise, there will be some nitty gritty things that trip along that way.But in overall form, I think the roll out of the diesel subsidy rationalisation has been reasonably handled and it is actually part and parcel of our daily lives now. We want to get to the same outcome for RON95.If you ask me to give a date, I think the rigour, the double checking, testing, and simulating is more important. We are testing the system that we will use to make sure it works, so we have fewer issues by the time we roll out.The principle is that 85% of the rakyat will not be affected. We want to make sure that society is protected through the process. We also stick to the principles that we want to use a system that is easily managed and rides on tools that we can see.> The individual tax relief has been RM9,000 for years. Is that realistic?The government has no immediate plans to lift the rate from RM9,000. We believe a much more targeted mechanism tool is a better way to do it.\u00a0The government is actually offering more tax reliefs, but targeted at certain groups. Last year, we gave first time house buyers, because we are concerned that the young generation will not be able to come on the ownership side.We also gave waivers to people who are looking after their parents in terms of medical needs.I think those are much better tools, rather than blanket waivers to give along the way.> Some ministries have indicated that they want to manage their own tax collection. Is this being considered?We are guided by what is stated in the Federal Constitution, that all monies and revenue collected is deemed federal and must go into the consolidated fund.We can agree on the mechanism [to share funds] but it must still come into the consolidated fund and we can increase the allocation after that.For example, for the sugar tax, we have an agreement with the Health Ministry for any new additional collection we get, we will share a portion of that with the ministry so targeted interventions can be done.We also have agreements with the Road Transport Department when they do special number plates, some proceeds are used for road safety.We want to encourage ministries to look for ways to self generate in a reasonable form. We are prepared to share some of it along the way, but there\u2019s no natural entitlement.> Is the RM1.2 trillion national debt level sustainable?In 2021, the fiscal deficit of the GDP was 6.5%, and we brought it to 5.5% the following year, and in 2023 we took it down to 5%. Last year, despite a target of 4.3%, we achieved 4.1%.This puts us on a good trajectory to achieve targets in the Fiscal Responsibility Act that by the end of 2028, we should be below 3%. This year\u2019s target is 3.8% and I think we can do a bit better than that.We want to address debt but we have to be practical. As long as we run a deficit, the absolute debt will go up. The proportion of debt to GDP is important. GDP is your ability to pay, our earning level. As long as we bring down the ratio of debt to GDP, we are on the right track.Every year since 2021, there was RM100bil new debt coming in, then it reduced to RM90bil, and last year it was down around RM77bil. We have been reducing the fiscal deficit. I believe we can get on the path of achieving debt to GDP below 60% at the end of 2028.> PETRONAS dividends are an important source of revenue for the government. With what\u2019s happening between PETRONAS and Petroleum Sarawak Berhad (Petros) are you expecting lower dividends in the future?The revenue from PETRONAS at one point was more than 40% of total government revenue. In 2023, it declined to about 19% to 20%, and in current projections, we are going to try to take it down to about 15% while at the same time growing other sources of revenue.So then again, same concept \u2013 diversification. We should not be overly dependent on one.As for PETRONAS and Petros, discussions are still ongoing. They have worked out a win-win solution. If there is some sharing of revenue that happens along the way, does the country lose? The answer is no.If Petros were to gain some money, they would still spend it to grow the oil and gas industry in Sarawak. From the GDP point of view, the country still gets revenue, just that it is allocated from a different vehicle.We have to recognise that PETRONAS has done well over all the years. It built a Fortune 500 company. It has been growing well overseas. In that sense, it has resilience in its system.It may have to do some optimisation to sustain, and I am sure [PETRONAS CEO] Tan Sri Tengku Muhammad Taufik Tengku Kamadjaja Aziz and the leadership there will be looking at how to sustain better going forward.The country has progressed compared with the earlier days and our dependency on PETRONAS has declined over the years.If you look by segment, FDI [foreign direct investment] now is translating into construction because they need to build data centres, new factories.I saw some numbers not too long ago from the Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry and Bank Negara Malaysia which say in the past about 70% of all approved investments were converted to reality and that number has now increased to 78.7%. So that\u2019s good. It is really making sure that what we promised translates on the ground.This February, we pushed up the minimum wage to RM1,700. What it does is it spurs private consumption. The leg of the economy now will have FDI, DDI [domestic direct investment], and private consumption. We just need to focus on how we continue to feed this engine, so the whole economy will continue to churn well.Is it going to be perfectly smooth? Nothing in the world is perfectly smooth, but if you focus well and get more done, have the resilience, our plans are clear, we have the ability to transform the economy> What has your journey been like moving from boardrooms to government service?I have been a corporate person all my life, working at Shell then moving to the PETRONAS group of companies and so on.It took me a while to agree to become a minister because the role is very different from the things I did. But the PM has given me space to help him in different ways. I hope I contribute enough to help him do a good job in the Finance Ministry.There is also some learning that I have to do. When you work for a corporation, your delivery period is short. Here, it is about how we balance long-term policy changes, how we have to think through the consequences of decisions we make, how to work with a wide range of groups and somehow get people to align with a common goal.It\u2019s been a lot of hard work, a lot of sleepless nights, but I have truly enjoyed the journey. I hope it has made an impact and people can see some of the good impact coming from our work.> What has been the most challenging period for you in the past two years?I am somewhat of a private person, you never find me very much on social media and all, but some things come with the job. So having to understand that it comes with the job and being able to do it well enough is something I have to address.\u00a0There's some things ... that with it, carries a role. You are supposed to recognise that you are a symbol. You cannot do things that disrespect the role you are trying to do. There are a lot of changes that have to be adjusted to.\u00a0I\u2019m very grateful that I have a very supportive family, I think that has helped to manage this process.> What is one thing you have done in the past two years that is worth mentioning?There is nothing that one does that is solely one\u2019s work.You can only achieve things when you have the whole system adjusted. When we wanted to do the diesel rationalisation, people said it cannot be done, it is going to break, it is going to cause inflation, there will be protests in the street.I am proud of the fact that even with difficult decisions, we have a great bunch of people who are willing to work the hours and make sure it is not just the system and policy but everything is done well.Personally, I\u2019m gratified that we can see some of the decisions that we made that were translated on the ground and we are beginning to see the right signs that we are pushing the country forward.I learned a lot in this job, I have to adapt to a lot in it. I never thought I would go into Parliament and answer questions, but now I have to, it is part and parcel of the job.But neither did I believe that I would have the opportunity to work with a lot of good people and find common alignment and start making a difference.Hopefully we will carry a better Malaysia forward. So it has been a fulfilling journey.",

        "content": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Agriculture and Food Security Ministry will increase the production of lower-priced special grade chicken eggs following the government's decision to end egg subsidies on Aug 1, says Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu.The Agriculture and Food Security Minister said this would provide the public with more affordable eggs while helping to stabilise prices.\"We also aim to increase the supply of cheaper special eggs like those sold during Ramadan (in March) recently, priced at RM5 per tray.\"We're not sure what the price will be but we are confident it will not spike uncontrollably,\" he said after attending the Terengganu Pakatan Harapan Aidilfitri open house here on Sunday (May 4).On April 30, the ministry announced that subsidies for eggs would be removed and said that several intervention measures would be implemented jointly with the Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry to minimise the impact on the people's cost of living.Mohamad also said in addition to special grade eggs, the public could obtain competitively priced eggs through nationwide initiatives such as Jualan Agro Madani and Jualan Rahmah.He also said the decision to end both egg subsidies and price controls \u2013 as well as the reduction in subsidy rate from RM0.10 to RM0.05 per egg effective May 1 \u2013 was made through stakeholder engagement.\"The decision was made via consultation. We negotiated first with egg producers and industry players. We also implemented the removal gradually, not abruptly. Hence, I believe egg prices will not surge,\" he said.Meanwhile, Mohamad also encouraged the cultivation of local young coconuts, especially aromatic varieties like pandan coconuts, in response to rising demand from China.\"This presents an opportunity in Terengganu for example, with its vast land.\"China has a population of over 1.4 billion, with more than 800 million with spending power... this is a real economic opportunity,\" he said.On April 19, Agriculture Department director-general Datuk Nor Sam Alwi said the opening of the fresh coconut market to China under the Phytosanitary Requirements Protocol marks a strengthening of biosecurity measures and the establishment of a more systematic traceability element in quality young coconut production.He said Malaysia would export young coconuts primarily for fresh beverage consumption, with priority given to aromatic varieties such as pandan coconuts which are known for their unique fragrance and a brix sweetness level of around 6.7. \u2013 Bernama\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd (Carlsberg Malaysia) is poised to deliver seasonally strong results for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2024 (4Q24), potentially marking a record full-year performance, according to UOB Kay Hian (UOBKH) Research.The research house expects the early Chinese New Year this year to boost sales volume, as orders are front-loaded into 4Q24.\u201cWhile sales volume is already expected to pick up seasonally, the early Chinese New Year celebrations in 2025 should result in stronger sell-in for the brewers as orders are front-loaded into 4Q24.\u201cEarnings for the period should see an uptick, both sequentially and year-on-year (y-o-y), although margins are likely to be slightly compressed by an increase in festive marketing spend,\u201d the research firm said.\u201cThe anticipated uptick in sales and strong results thus far signals a record year for Carlsberg Malaysia.\u201dHowever, it noted that sales volume would likely normalise downward in 1Q25.The immediate outlook for 2025 remains clouded by mixed signals in discretionary spending, the research firm pointed out.On the downside, it said the removal of broad-based subsidies in favour of a targeted approach could dampen consumer spending, particularly among the middle-to-upper-middle income group.\u201cThis could slow Carlsberg\u2019s premiumisation efforts, resulting in potential margin compression should consumers tighten their purse strings,\u201d it added.On the flip side, UOBKH Research noted that the minimum wage increase to RM1,700, effective February, could support consumption of Carlsberg Malaysia\u2019s more affordable products, such as its Carlsberg brand. Moreover, the ongoing recovery in the tourism sector could also bolster Carlsberg\u2019s performance.UOBKH Research highlighted that as of November 2024, tourist arrivals in Malaysia had already exceeded full-year 2023 figures by 11.5%.\u201cWhile the sector has yet to fully recover to its pre-pandemic heights, an uptick in tourist spending should benefit Carlsberg\u2019s sales volume, especially for the on-trade segment which had slowed down post pandemic as consumption patterns shifted away from on-premise drinking\u201d it said.\u201cRecall that while historically the volume split between on-trade and off-trade was 60-40. This was reversed after Covid-19 and the on-trade segment has still yet to fully recover.\u201dOperationally, UOBKH Research said Carlsberg Malaysia appears to be \u201csolid\u201d, supported by stable raw material pricing and US dollar-to-ringgit exchange rates.It expects the brewery\u2019s 5% price hike in April 2024 to also provide a margin buffer in case of unexpected cost increases.\u201cHowever, we expect marketing costs to sustain at current levels with Carlsberg Malaysia consistently guiding that it will continue pushing marketing initiatives to grow its market share,\u201d it noted.Meanwhile, following the RM92mil brewery upgrade completed in its financial year 2024, the research firm expects Carlsberg Malaysia\u2019s capital expenditure to normalise and return to a maintenance cycle moving forward.",

        "content": "HONG KONG: The Housing and Local Government Ministry is coming up with a new model of public housing named \"Program Residensi Rakyat (PRR)\", says its minister Nga Kor Ming.He said the PRR would be well-integrated, sustainable and liveable, accommodating quality commercial viability, green spaces, community centre and other features.The construction cost of each PRR unit, he said, would also be increased to RM300,000, offering the low-income group quality homes with a piecemeal price.Under the new PRR, a unit costing RM300,000 would be sold at RM60,000.Out of the RM60,000, about RM10,000 to RM15,000 will be set aside for maintenance and sinking funds.\"There will also be a moratorium whereby for 10 years, you cannot sell the PRR unit, as we do not want irresponsible parties to take advantage of our social housing because this is a privilege for you to be afforded a heavy subsidy,\" he told Bernama and The Edge at the Asia Real Estate Leader's (AREL) Study Tour Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China Edition.The study tour was initiated by Rehda Institute, the research and training arm of the Real Estate and Housing Developers\u2019 Association (Rehda) Malaysia, with over 50 delegates visiting many unique sites, covering urban redevelopment and public housing policies and strata laws.The delegates consisted of various stakeholders including architects, surveyors, valuers, researchers, developers, town planners, lawyers, bankers and government authorities.The minimum size for the PRR would be 750 square feet (sq ft) with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.Nga said the ministry would also emphasise connectivity through transit-oriented development (TOD), which is expected to reduce the number of vehicles and car park lots.The PPR will also be integrated with green buildings, making it 30% lower in energy costs compared with standard buildings.\"We are hoping to get an extra budget. Compared with Singapore\u2019s HDB which has an annual budget of SG$30bil, Malaysia's PPR only gets RM550mil, which is too small,\" he said.Meanwhile, Nga also called upon developers especially active members of Rehda and financial institutions to help the government to develop the many ageing buildings in the country especially those that are categorised as unsafe.He added that the common engineering standard benchmark for a building's lifespan is 70 years on average.However, Nga said the situation is still challenging as currently, the consent threshold needs 100% consent.\"Therefore the ministry is proposing a consent threshold between 75% to 80%, depending on the age of the building, and subject to further discussion,\" said the minister adding that the Act also proposed to cover abandoned projects with 51% consent threshold.Nga also stressed that while there would be a lot of opportunities for property developers to explore in the urban redevelopment effort, owners of existing property would be compensated fairly subject to valuation assessment.Besides, the setting up of the urban renewal authority and land tribunal are also in the pipeline to be parked under ministry, he said.\"This will be a fair and balanced legislation. While we are pushing for development, we shall also protect houseowners.\"This is the Madani government, we will ensure a fair solution for both sides (owners and developers),\" he added. - Bernama",

He added that it would be sold for RM40,000.\"With the amount of subsidies given by the government, it's like an 'angpow' which is a blessing under the 'Rahmah' spirit,\" he said when responding to Datuk Dr Alias Razak's (PN-Kuala Nerus) supplementary question in the Dewan Rakyat on Tuesday (Oct 31).Alias had asked Nga if it was possible to increase the size of the PPR units to accommodate bigger households.Nga said the current standard specification has already been increased from the previous 500 sqft, and increasing its size will cost more.Alias then said that such limited space would cause children from big families to spend more time outdoors, which would risk social problems.In response, the Taiping MP said that the latest design of PPR projects would also be constructed in a well-integrated concept.\"The housing will include several facilities, such as recreational areas, food courts, convenience stores, and we will try to add in clinics,\" said Nga.When tabling the 2024 Budget, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced an allocation of RM2.47bil to implement people's housing projects (PPR) next year.Anwar, also the Finance Minister, said this included a special RM1bil guarantee fund to encourage responsible developers to rebuild abandoned projects which have been identified.

        "content": "PETALING JAYA: Restructuring subsidies is a good first step, but the government must also look at other aspects such as housing and public health in order to help the poor and vulnerable, say experts and consumer groups.There will always be individuals who fall through the cracks and become the hardcore poor, they said, but what is critical is to build a social safety net and support system to \u201ccatch\u201d them.However, they lauded the administration\u2019s concerted focus on ending poverty and aiding low income individuals and families in the 12th Malaysia Plan Mid-Term Review.\u201cThere is a clear commitment from the government to recognise and address these issues,\u201d said sociologist and poverty researcher Dr Denison Jayasooria.\u201cBut it needs a more concerted effort and more organised mechanisms to address the problem in an inclusive way and by bringing all the actions and actors together,\u201d said Denison, who is a former professor at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.The 12MP Mid-Term Review released yesterday outlined the unity government\u2019s measures to aid low income individuals and end hardcore poverty by restructuring how subsidies and aid are distributed.The government will use a central database system called PADU that streamlines all types of government aid that is currently spread out across different agencies and ministries.Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim also said cash transfers and the various programmes under the Payung Rahmah initiative, such as discounted sales of household necessities and budget restaurant menus, will be continued.While the Rahmah programmes have been beneficial, consumer advocate Datuk Paul Selvaraj said there are other factors, such as access to quality healthcare and affordable housing, that can help bring down the cost of living.\u201cFood and daily household goods are one element of the cost of living picture.\u201cThere are also other costs that weigh families down, such as schooling, healthcare and housing. These also need to be tackled,\u201d said Selvaraj, who is deputy president of the Federation of Malaysian Consumer Associations (Fomca).Another potential financial time bomb is the retirement savings of many working Malaysians that have been hollowed out due to the Covid-19 lockdowns, said Selvaraj.\u201cThis is a future crisis that the government has to absolutely do something about. We have to rebuild our social protections.\u201dEchoing this sentiment, Denison said the problems could be too large for any government to tackle alone.\u201cThe 12MP mentioned that the government wants to work with civil society as charity and faith groups are good at reaching the pockets of poverty that elude the state\u2019s machinery. This is something laudable, and we hope that the civil service takes it seriously and integrates civil society into programmes aimed at the poor,\u201d Dennison said.",

        "title": "Cost of living in Malaysia rises moderately despite low inflation",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR:  Malaysia's cost of living, as indicated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is on the rise, influenced by global economic uncertainties and domestic policy challenges. However, inflation remains relatively low. In March 2025, Malaysia's inflation rate eased to 1.4 per cent, slightly down from 1.7 per cent in January and 1.5 per cent in February, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM). The CPI rose to 134.1 points in March, compared to 132.2 points in the same month last year. DOSM reported that this year's rising cost of living is primarily driven by price increases in several categories, including food and beverages, accommodation services, personal care, education, and insurance and financial services. Economists suggest that this trend reflects a delicate balancing act between external economic pressures and Malaysia's efforts to stabilise its domestic market. To address the rising cost of living, Dr. Oh Ei Sun, Senior Fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, calls for comprehensive structural reforms to ease the financial burden on citizens. He emphasises the necessity of reducing regulatory burdens by reforming tax and subsidy systems, enhancing public services, and simplifying compliance processes. These measures aim to bolster productivity, foster competition, and fortify economic resilience. Dr Oh said that Malaysia's heavy reliance on imports for essential goods, particularly food and energy, makes local prices susceptible to global market fluctuations. He said that this dependence exposes Malaysia to international price volatility, affecting domestic costs. \u200b Fluctuations in global fuel prices and a weakened ringgit further exacerbate the cost of imported goods, impacting daily expenses, he told Business Times. Retailers and businesses, facing increased operational costs, often pass these expenses onto consumers, contributing to the overall rise in living costs, he said. Dr Oh warns that as worldwide prices increase due to geopolitical concerns, local prices are likely to follow suit. He said that by implementing structural reforms, Malaysia can work towards achieving high-income status and improving the standard of living for its citizens. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has emphasised the importance of continuing structural reforms to achieve high-income status, despite short-term risks such as potential global trade wars and rising geopolitical tensions. The central bank maintains its economic growth forecast for 2025 between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent. It anticipates sustained strong economic activity driven by domestic demand and manageable inflation despite external uncertainties. The World Bank's Economic Outlook for Malaysia indicates a moderation in economic growth to 3.9 per cent in 2025, with headline inflation expected to increase to 2.6 per cent. This reflects several domestic policy reforms amid moderating cost conditions, mainly due to lower commodity prices .\u200b Challenges faced by households According to Dr Oh, food expenses alone can constitute up to 20 per cent of household income, rendering price increases in this sector especially burdensome. He noted that inflation in Malaysia tends to be gradual but persistent, often outpacing wage growth and leading to affordability challenges for many households. \"So when worldwide prices of these rise, local prices rise as well,\" he said. Government measures, such as subsidies, have been implemented to mitigate these challenges. However, fiscal constraints have led to a shift towards targeted subsidies, aiming to reduce expenditure and minimise leakages. Despite these efforts, wage levels have not kept pace with the rising cost of living, with many workers experiencing stagnation despite increased expenses. Additionally, he said that speculative activities in the property market and the phenomenon of price stickiness\u2014where prices remain elevated even after initial hikes\u2014exacerbate the situation. \"Evidently the levels of wage rising are not enough. The cost of living rose manyfold over the past decades, but wages are still stagnating at similar levels to the end of last century,\" Dr Oh said. \"Inflation tends to creep in Malaysia. Although it doesn't spike suddenly, people feel prices of essential goods and services rise steadily, much more than their incomes rise. So it's a question of affordability.\" Dr Oh said the impact is particularly severe on lower-income households, which allocate a larger share of their income to necessities, leaving little room for savings. He emphasised that the levels of wage increases are not sufficient, as the cost of living has risen significantly over past decades, while wages remain relatively stagnant. Dr Oh pointed out that sectors like food and accommodation are experiencing above-average price increases, intensifying the financial strain on these communities. To cope with rising living costs, he advised individuals to reduce non-essential spending, though this approach can diminish quality of life. Economist: Malaysia's inflation rate lowest among Asean nations Putra Business School economic analyst Associate Prof. Dr. Ahmed Razman Abdul Latiff said Malaysia's inflation rate is considered among the lowest compared to other Asean nations. He attributed the rising cost of living to a combination of external factors, such as global economic uncertainties, and internal factors, including domestic policy challenges. External factors like climate change have disrupted agricultural yields, leading to increased food prices, while geopolitical tensions have contributed to supply chain disruptions, further elevating costs. At home, a weaker ringgit has made imports more expensive, affecting the prices of essential goods and services. Dr Razman also observed that domestic factors, including increased material costs and heightened consumer spending, have put upward pressure on prices. He anticipates that the cost of living in Malaysia will continue to rise annually.\u200b Dr Razman emphasised the necessity of long-term solutions, such as monetary system reforms and initiatives to boost income levels, to address the underlying issues contributing to the increasing cost of living.\u200b The government's decision to raise the minimum wage from RM1,500 to RM1,700 in February 2025 aims to improve income levels. However, Dr Razman pointed out that many workers still lack the bargaining power to negotiate better wages, and the increase may not be sufficient to offset the rising cost of living. He highlighted that wages have been increasing gradually on a yearly basis, but such increments among low-level wages are not enough to cover the rising cost of living. \"The rising cost of living not only caused the lower-income households to have very minimal disposable income but also caused some to resort to taking debts to survive,\" he said. Dr Razman noted that the increase in food prices plays a significant role in the overall cost of living in Malaysia, as food costs constitute a substantial portion of the inflation rate calculation.\u200b In response, the government has implemented price controls on basic goods and services, such as rice, cooking oil, and electricity tariffs, to keep inflation in check. Efforts are also underway to rationalise subsidies, focusing on targeted assistance for lower-income groups through programs like Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah (STR) and Sumbangan Asas Rahmah (SARA). Riding the wave Samuel Tan, chief executive officer of Olive Tree Property Consultants, said that imported inflation is a key factor driving the rising cost of living in Malaysia, particularly when the ringgit weakens against the currencies of exporting countries. This causes the prices of imported goods to rise. \"The weakening of the ringgit against foreign currencies contributes to imported inflation, making imported goods more expensive. This has a significant impact on the cost of living in Malaysia, especially for items that rely on foreign sourcing,\" he explained. Tan pointed out that sectors such as housing, food, and transportation have experienced the most significant price increases. Additionally, occasional hikes in utility tariffs further add to the financial strain. Urban areas, such as Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, and Penang, have felt these price increases more sharply than rural areas, he added. \"As the prices of individual components rise, the ripple effect results in higher costs across various sectors. This interconnectedness means that price increases in one area often lead to higher prices in others,\" Tan said. Tan said that as the prices of individual components rise, the ripple effect results in higher costs across various sectors. This interconnection means that increases in one area often lead to price hikes in others. \"The government is working to reduce the cost of doing business by eliminating unnecessary costs and taxes, which ultimately burden consumers. There should be a strong focus on sourcing products and services locally to mitigate the impact of imported inflation. \"For vulnerable groups, such as the poor and marginalised, the government provides cash assistance or vouchers to help offset rising expenses,\" he said. Tan noted that wages have not kept up with the increasing cost of living. \"Wage growth typically follows improvements in productivity and profitability, but not all companies are adjusting wages to align with rising living costs. Some businesses offer Cost of Living Allowances (COLA) for employees transferred to areas with higher living expenses, but this is not consistent across the board. \"Lower-income households, particularly those in the B40 (Bottom 40 per cent) income group, are the hardest hit. This group, with households earning up to RM5,249 per month, benefits from various government subsidies and assistance programmes. \"However, the M40 (Middle 40 per cent) group, which earns between RM5,250 and RM11,819 per month, faces a particular challenge, as they receive fewer subsidies and their income often falls short of meeting rising costs. Greater support for this segment is needed,\" he said. He pointed out that as of 2024, Malaysia has a relatively lower cost of living compared to many other Asean countries. While Malaysia provides a good balance of affordability and quality of life, regional differences in costs\u2014particularly for housing, transportation, food, and healthcare\u2014should be considered when comparing various locations, he said. In terms of steps to be taken to mitigate the effects of rising living costs in Malaysia, Tan said, \"Financial literacy should be taught from an early age, ideally integrated into school curricula, to help individuals plan their finances effectively. As people grow older, they can learn to spend wisely and pursue financial independence by diversifying income sources through side businesses, investments, and savings. Building a savings habit is essential for managing unexpected events and ensuring financial stability.\" Tan added that young Malaysians face challenges in raising the initial deposit for homes due to escalating house prices. While government schemes exist to help bridge the gap, the rising cost of homes is still a barrier for many. Tan said state governments should prioritise the development of affordable housing options, and financing should be made more accessible for qualified individuals. Renting may be a more flexible and realistic option for many until they can afford homeownership, he said.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's full-year inflation is expected to remain at 2.4 per cent year-on-year, but PublicInvest has warned of possible upward pressure. The research house said domestic cost pressures from policy changes such as fuel subsidy cuts, utility rate adjustments and labour-related levies, are being monitored, though their impact on consumer prices appears slower than expected. It noted a slight uptick in core inflation but said overall price trends remain contained. \"On the external front, the introduction of the US Reciprocal Trade Tariff Act, despite the temporary 90-day pause, has reintroduced trade policy uncertainty,\" it said. \"This, combined with continued foreign exchange volatility and fluctuations in global commodity prices, could add to cost-side pressures in the second half of 2025 (2H25). The impact is likely to be uneven across sectors, particularly those sensitive to import costs.\" PublicInvest expects inflation to pick up in 2H25, driven by planned policy moves including the removal of RON95 subsidies, minimum wage hikes and a wider application of the sales and services tax. Further pressure may also come from new cuts to subsidies for essential goods, potential electricity tariff hikes and rising labour costs due to mandatory Employees Provident Fund contributions and the foreign worker levy. \"Industry sentiment suggests mounting concern over the timing of fiscal consolidation efforts, with businesses increasingly calling for a pause in policy measures that may raise operating costs, particularly following the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs. \"A recalibration of the reform schedule could support a more contained inflation environment, especially if heightened global competition results in greater price discounting across import-dependent sectors,\" it said. PublicInvest maintained its forecast for the overnight policy rate at three per cent, adding that monetary policy in 2H25 will depend on how domestic subsidies are adjusted and on further developments in global trade. \"With domestic activity broadly aligning with Bank Negara Malaysia's baseline projections and downside risks to growth remaining, we expect the MPC to adopt a cautious stance and keep the policy rate unchanged in the near term,\" it added.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association Malaysia (Rehda) reported a 45 per cent drop in property sales in the second half of 2024 (2H24), with sales declining from 6,907 units in 1H24 to 3,802 units in 2H24. According to Rehda's Property Industry Sentiment Survey 2H24, based on 127 member developers, the number of launched units also fell 7 per cent to 13,611 units during the period. Apartments and condominiums remained the top-selling property types, followed by serviced residences and 2-3 storey terrace houses. Rehda president Datuk Ir Ho Hon Sang attributed the lower sales figures to developers frontloading their launches earlier in the year. \"Despite the lower numbers reported by our members, we believe that this is due to developers completing their launches in early 2024, and we expect to see an increase in the next survey,\" he said at the media briefing of the Rehda Property Industry Survey 2H24 and Market Outlook for 2025 here today. The survey revealed that 41 per cent of respondents had unsold completed residential units as of Dec 31, 2024, with 43 per cent of these priced between RM400,001 and RM500,000. The top three types of unsold completed units were serviced residences (55 per cent), single-storey terraces (16 per cent), and condominiums (8 per cent). The primary reasons cited were end-financing loan rejections and low buyer demand. Loan rejections were largely attributed to buyers' ineligibility due to income levels, inadequate financial documentation, and adverse credit history, according to the survey. Additionally, 77 per cent of unsold completed Bumiputera units were priced between RM300,001 and RM500,000, with 72 per cent remaining unsold for more than 36 months. The industry also faced rising operational costs, with the majority of developers reporting a three to six per cent increase in the overall cost of doing business. Construction challenges were prevalent, with 56 per cent of respondents citing issues related to building materials and labour. Developers highlighted concerns such as high material prices, supply shortages, and inconsistent supply, while labour challenges included high wages, manpower shortages, and lengthy approval processes. He said the association acknowledged the government's efforts in addressing challenges related to building materials and labour. \"But we hope the government recognises that these challenges become more costly to address the longer they persist, not just for the industry but for the economy as well,\" he said. He said 37 per cent of respondents reported that they were affected by the economic scenario within the period under review, leading them to take various cost-cutting measures both operation- and production-wise. These included freezing recruitments, offering fewer benefits or perks, rescheduling the launching of planned projects and reducing the scale of launches. Looking ahead, Rehda said market sentiment for 1H25 remains neutral, but developers anticipate improved conditions in the second half of the year. However, it noted that uncertainties persist, with concerns over utility hikes, petrol subsidy reviews, unexpected taxes, and regulatory cost impacts that could drive up development expenses. \"There are still many concerns in the industry, given the various challenges faced by stakeholders. \"However, we trust that the government will continue to prioritise the interests of Malaysians and the industry, and we hope that any changes introduced will reflect this,\" Ho said. Despite these challenges, Rehda reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the nation's housing agenda by ensuring the timely and sustainable delivery of quality, affordable homes.",

        "title": "Stagnant wages, rising food costs push low-income families into poor diets, says study",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Rising food costs and stagnant wages are forcing Malaysia's low-income urban households into unhealthy eating habits, leading to a growing public health crisis of malnutrition and obesity. A recent study by the Social Wellbeing Research Centre (SWRC) at Universiti Malaya found that many struggling families rely on instant noodles, fried foods, and sugary drinks instead of nutritious meals. The study, titled Food Affordability in Malaysia: When Markets and Money Decide What to Eat by Amjad Rabi and Norma Mansor stated that food affordability was a challenge for urban communities, where wages remain low despite government subsidies keeping food prices below global averages. Unlike rural households that may have access to homegrown food, city dwellers must purchase everything they eat, making them especially vulnerable to inflation and economic downturns. The report revealed that many Malaysians could not afford basic nutritious foods such as dairy and fresh produce. \"For instance, while a minimum-wage worker in the Netherlands needs only four minutes of labour to buy one litre of milk, a Malaysian worker must work for 58 minutes to afford the same amount. \"This affordability gap forces many households to substitute unhealthy, calorie-dense alternatives such as instant noodles and fried foods, which are cheaper but nutritionally inadequate. \"This dietary shift contributes to rising malnutrition rates, including both undernutrition and obesity, particularly among urban low-income populations who face limited access to fresh and healthy food.\" A recent Unicef study cited in the report found that nearly half of the surveyed families increased their consumption of instant noodles in 2023, up from 40 per cent during the pandemic. This dietary shift has had severe consequences, particularly for children in low-cost housing areas. The study found that 15 per cent of children under five in these communities are underweight, while 22 per cent experience stunted growth due to a lack of proper nutrition. At the same time, 23 per cent of children in these areas are overweight or obese, highlighting the country's struggle with a dual burden of malnutrition. It added that the phenomenon, known as the \"nutrition transition,\" is becoming a major concern. \" \"Low-income families are being forced into unhealthy eating habits because they simply cannot afford better options. \"We are seeing an increase in diet-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, which will place a heavy burden on Malaysia's healthcare system in the coming decades.\" The situation has worsened with rising inflation, as Malaysia's food price inflation reached 6.8 per cent in 2022, with staple food items such as rice, chicken, and vegetables experiencing sharp price hikes. The study added that urban households, which rely entirely on food markets, are particularly vulnerable to these price fluctuations, as they lack the resilience of rural communities that may have alternative food sources. The report called for urgent policy interventions to address this crisis, including expanding school feeding programmes to ensure children receive at least one nutritious meal per day. The study also urged the government to introduce an automatic minimum wage adjustment system that keeps up with inflation, ensuring that low-income households can afford a balanced diet. Additionally, it recommended strengthening social protection measures, particularly for children and the elderly, to reduce the risk of malnutrition caused by financial hardship.",

        "title": "Five steps to secure Malaysia's healthcare system",
        "content": "LETTERS: Malaysia's struggle with nursing shortages dates back decades. In the early 2000s, the government took significant steps to increase the nursing workforce, largely by boosting the number of nursing graduates. The country has a nurse-to-population ratio of only 3.6 per 1,000 people, far below the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 9.2 per 1,000  (2024). The situation has been exacerbated by a mass exodus of nurses from public healthcare institutions, with many seeking better opportunities abroad. A big factor is the migration of nurses to countries that offer better salaries and working conditions. For example, Singapore offers salaries nearly double that of Malaysia, along with housing allowances and career advancement opportunities. Similarly,  nurses in Saudi Arabia and Dubai earn significantly more, often tax-free. Secondly, public hospitals in Malaysia are frequently overcrowded, forcing many to work long hours, including night shifts, weekends, and public holidays,  without adequate compensation or rest. The recent introduction of a 45-hour work week has not significantly alleviated the pressure on nurses, as understaffing continues to be a major issue. Another factor is the lack of career advancement opportunities within Malaysia's healthcare system. The lack of professional growth discourages nurses from remaining in the public sector, prompting them to seek opportunities elsewhere. In addition, the number of nursing vacancies has steadily increased over the past five years, from 2,106 in 2020 to 6,896 in 2023. Many nurses were initially hired on short-term contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic, but as the crisis subsided, contract renewals were reduced. Without permanent positions, these nurses lacked job security, structured career progression, and benefits such as pensions and housing allowances. To prevent further deterioration of Malaysia's healthcare system, immediate interventions are  necessary: 1. The government must offer competitive salaries and additional benefits. Salary adjustments should reflect the rising cost of living, and incentives such as housing allowances, transport subsidies, and overtime pay should be provided. 2. Hospitals must invest in better infrastructure and access to modern medical equipment and reduce the administrative burden on nurses, especially overworking, and mandated rest periods should be enforced. 3. Allocate more resources for nursing education and create clear career advancement pathways. 4. The Health Ministry should implement policies that encourage nurses to stay in the public sector, such as offering long-term contracts, structured career progression plans, and mentorship programmes. 5. Collaboration between the public and private healthcare sectors is essential to addressing the nursing shortage. The private sector can contribute by funding nursing education, while public hospitals can focus on structured career pathways to retain experienced nurses. Ensuring that Malaysia's nurses are valued, supported and retained is the only way to secure the future of the nation's healthcare system.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will pay Arm Holdings US$250 million over 10 years to acquire the firm's chip design plans for local manufacturers, the government said on Wednesday as it looks to produce its own chips within the next decade amid an AI boom. The Southeast Asian nation plans to produce its own graphics processing unit chips in the next five to 10 years as demand for artificial intelligence and data centres grows. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli said the government will pay Arm for its intellectual property, including seven of its high-end chip design blueprints. The deal will also involve the training of 10,000 engineers in Malaysia, Rafizi told media ahead of the deal's formal announcement. Malaysia hopes the deal with Arm will allow domestic producers to scale up, creating 10 local chip companies with yearly revenue of US$1.5 to US$2 billion each, Rafizi said. The economy ministry and Arm will each have a set of selection criteria for the local companies, given the value of the intellectual property involved and to ensure successful production, Rafizi added. The government will identify local companies with the capabilities and expertise to quickly begin manufacturing. A host of technology giants, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet unit Google, and China's ByteDance, have announced billions of dollars of digital investments in Malaysia since 2023, mostly in cloud services and data centres, powering an infrastructure boom driven by growing AI demand. Last April, Malaysia said it planned to build Southeast Asia's largest integrated-circuit design park and would offer incentives including tax breaks, subsidies and exemption from visa fees to attract global tech companies and investors. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the park will house world-class anchor tenants and collaborate with global companies such as Arm.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's property market is expected to continue growing at a steady pace this year despite concerns over high living costs, shrinking purchasing power and global economic uncertainties, according to Rahim and Co. Its executive chairman Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Abdul Rahman said the market will be driven by the convergence of digitalisation, sustainability, environmental, social and governance awareness and a growing demand for integrated urban living. Abdul Rahim said with continued government support, such as through incentives for affordable housing, investor- friendly policies, as well as green building and tech-driven initiatives, the market is expected to continue regenerating steadily. \"While market challenges remain, the outlook is positive for those who can adapt to the market's evolving needs especially with the promising indicators of late,\" he said at the preview of Rahim and Co Property Market Review 2024/2025 report here, today. The Malaysian property market closed 2024 on a strong note, building on a solid nine month performance marked by increased transactions across all property subsectors. According to the report, the total volume of property transactions rose 6.2 per cent, while the total cumulative value of transactions grew 14.4 per cent. \"This amounted to 311,211 transactions worth RM162.96 billion for the first three quarters of the year. The surge in 2024 exceeded expectations, signalling a potential market acceleration compared to 2023,\" the report said. Despite the increased market activity, Abdul Rahim said buyers' sentiment remains cautious, as many face the challenges of rising costs and sluggish income growth amid affordability concerns. He believes specific market performances vary between different locations, asset classes and pricing brackets. \"As a result, the tone for 2025 is likely to remain \"cautiously optimistic\", influenced by factors such as fuel subsidy and electricity tariff adjustments, along with global uncertainties. \"Nevertheless, demand for well- established areas is expected to remain resilient. Affordable housing demand will continue, supported by government initiatives aimed at boosting the segment,\" he said. Rahim & Co director of research Sr Sulaiman Saheh\u00a0said the issue of ageing and abandoned buildings, particularly in urban areas, remains a concern. Sulaiman\u00a0noted that the proposed Urban Renewal Act is expected to address redevelopment challenges by lowering the consent threshold for strata-titled buildings. \"However, there are concerns especially on the issue of minority owners' interest which requires further refinement towards a more equitable approach. \"As we move into 2025, the residential sector is likely to sustain its growth, driven largely by demand from owner-occupiers, particularly in transit-oriented developments,\" he said. In addition, Sulaiman\u00a0said looking ahead, strategic infrastructure investments, including the East Coast Rail Link, Pan Borneo Highway and Rapid Transit System will create new investment opportunities. He said the refined MM2H programme and Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone are also expected to generate significant interest. \"In the commercial sector, despite supply pressures, 'flight-to-green' and 'flight-to-quality' trends will redefine the office and retail markets, creating a new narrative within the segment,\" he added.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's property market is expected to improve in 2025 on growing demand for transit-oriented development (TOD) projects and affordable housing projects, according to Titijaya Land Bhd. Group managing director Datuk Lim Poh Yit said the increasing demand for TOD projects are mainly comes from the younger generation of city workers. The tailwind for the TOD segment, Lim added, will be supported by public transport infrastructure projects being developed or planned across Malaysia. This includes the Klang Valley Double Track Phase 2, the East Coast Rail Link, Circle Line MRT 3, Light Rail Transit 3 and Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail. \"By concentrating offices, retail, and residences within the catchment area of transit stations, TOD projects make public transport more attractive and efficient, reducing dependence on personal vehicles and promoting shorter commutes. \"As a result, TOD typically translates into higher productivity and a smaller carbon footprint,\" he said in a statement. He said Titijaya is well-positioned to capitalise on this incredible market opportunity, supported by its mixed-development Riveria City in KL Sentral valued at RM1.5 billion. On affordable housing projects, Lim said buyers are becoming more cautious with their spending amid concerns over rising inflation, subsidy rationalisation and a potential rate hike in 2025. He said the increase in overnight policy rate (OPR) in 2023 resulted in higher monthly mortgage repayments for many Malaysian property buyers. He said those who have taken larger loans, particularly those who obtained floating-rate loans, will be impacted the most by higher OPR rates. \"Prices between RM500,000 and RM700,000 used to be a range that was favoured by local property buyers, but this has changed due to lower-than-expected spending power and higher living expenses. \"As a result, buyers who previously favoured units priced at RM500,000 are now looking for units priced at RM300,000,\" he added. Leveraging on this market trend, Lim said Titijaya's 44-hectare landbank across major Klang Valley cities will support its goal to provide accessible homeownership opportunities that will help create diverse communities, ensuring that quality living spaces are accessible to all.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) is challenging Malaysia's household classification, arguing that only the top 30 per cent of households are truly middle-income or aspirational. KRI's findings contrast with the government's view that the top 60 per cent, made up of Middle 40 (M40) and Top 20 (T20) groups, are middle class. Malaysia has consistently followed the World Bank's demarcation of Bottom 40 (B40)/M40/T20 from the Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) to the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP) for almost 15 years from 2006-2020. \"Our findings challenge the existing B40, M40 and T20 classification that reveals discrepancies between income demarcations and actual expenditure patterns,\" it said in a report entitled \"Searching for the 'Poor' and the 'Middle-Class' in Malaysia\" released today. KRI instead classifies households as Bottom 20 per cent (B20),\u00a0 Middle 50 per cent (M50) and Top 30 per cent (T30). KRI said B20 households are focused on meeting basic needs such as food, housing and clothing; M50 are economically unstable households navigating trade-offs between essential and aspirational goods while T30 households demonstrate aspirational consumption patterns indicative of the middle class, but not necessarily \"wealthy\" by global standards. KRI said the M50 group still face trade-offs between basic needs and more aspirational products, with only small differences from the B20 group. Some can afford dining out, send children to tuition, or buy more furniture. However, the M50 is not considered middle class and remains vulnerable. The KRI report comes amid the Economy Ministry's efforts to define and classify the top 15 income group, which will see a reduction in government subsidies.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: As 2024 draws to a close, Beyond the Headlines revisited the nation's transformative year marked by political stability, economic resilience, and societal shifts. The Unity Government, led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, has navigated a complex landscape, balancing coalition dynamics while addressing pressing national issues. Political Stability and Governance: In this episode to wrap up the year, the government's efforts to foster harmony within its diverse coalition were highlighted by the implementation of the Madani Economy framework. This ambitious initiative aimed to rebuild public trust and drive socio-economic growth, focused on equitable wealth distribution and sustainable development. Economic Challenges and the 2025 Budget: Malaysia's economic narrative in 2024 also revolved around global pressures and domestic initiatives. The 2025 Budget introduced targeted subsidies and income redistribution strategies to address inflationary pressures and the rising cost of living. However, external factors such as China's economic slowdown, global inflation, and the ringgit's volatility presented significant challenges. Business Times News Editor Presenna Nambiar highlighted the government's ability to maintain fiscal stability amidst these hurdles, emphasising the importance of balancing fiscal consolidation with welfare programs. Economist Dr Nungsari Ahmad Radhi added that addressing educational inequality and enhancing social safety nets were crucial steps toward bridging societal divides. Monetary Policy and the Ringgit: The ringgit's performance remained a focal point in 2024, influenced by fluctuating global markets and investor sentiment. While Bank Negara Malaysia implemented monetary policies to stabilise the currency, questions linger about the sufficiency of these measures and the need for greater economic diversification. Social Safety Nets and Inclusivity: Programmes like the Rahmah Cash Aid (STR) provided relief to vulnerable populations, but rising costs in food and housing underscored the need for expanded support. Observers have called for comprehensive measures to enhance affordability and reduce income disparities, which remain critical to fostering national unity. Regional Engagements and Future Opportunities: Participation in agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Belt and Road Initiative presented avenues for growth. Nonetheless, experts caution against over-dependence on these partnerships, advocating for strategic diversification to mitigate risks. Technology and Digital Economy: Government initiatives in tech education and innovation have positioned Malaysia as a burgeoning digital economy hub. Efforts to foster a competitive startup ecosystem and digital workforce were amplified in 2024, but further investments in infrastructure and skills development are necessary to sustain momentum. As Malaysia steps into 2025, the year's developments underscore the nation's resilience and adaptability. The Unity Government's balancing act of governance, economic policy, and social reform sets the stage for continued progress. While challenges remain, the foundations laid in 2024 offer hope for a more inclusive and prosperous Malaysia. Watch the full episode on NST Online's YouTube channel.",

The research house found that Anwar's efforts to attract foreign investors were particularly well received, followed by his work in enhancing Malaysia's global image, improving the civil service and addressing economic issues. \"At the same time, the federal government's approval rating rose to 51 per cent, up from 46 per cent in November 2023,\" said Merdeka Center. The survey assessed the government's performance based on eight criteria, including fostering economic growth, tackling the rising cost of living, promoting integrity, combating corruption and improving ethnic relations. Respondents showed satisfaction with the government's efforts across most parameters, with approval ratings increasing by between two per cent and 12 per cent. However, satisfaction with efforts to improve ethnic relations remained unchanged at 51 per cent. Conducted between Nov 27 and Dec 10, the survey gathered responses from 1,207 registered voters. The respondents comprised 52 per cent Malays, 29 per cent Chinese, seven per cent Indians, and six per cent each for Muslim Bumiputera and non-Muslim Bumiputera. Merdeka Center said dissatisfaction with the federal government stood at 47 per cent. \"The narrow margin between positive and negative perceptions is largely influenced by ongoing concerns over cost-of-living pressures and apprehensions about upcoming subsidy cuts,\" it added. The survey also found that 53 per cent of respondents believed the country was heading in the wrong direction, though this was a slight improvement of one per cent from the previous year. The main reasons cited for this view were economic challenges, mentioned by 47 per cent of respondents, poor governance by eight per cent, and political instability by seven per cent. Meanwhile, the percentage of voters who felt Malaysia was moving in the right direction increased modestly to 39 per cent, up from 36 per cent in November last year.",

        "content": "Community fears losing essential recreation space to developmentHISTORY is repeating itself as yet another vital water body in Kuala Lumpur is in danger of development.A move to degazette Taman Tasik Intan Baiduri recreation area in Kepong has raised alarm bells for the community living close to the site.While the land office has said the exercise is merely to create a bigger land reserve, stakeholders are questioning the motives behind the move.They are especially concerned as there was a previous attempt to degazette this area for a housing project.ALSO READ: Residents still waiting for long-promised city parkAdding to their worry is the alienation of land near Kampung Bohol flood retention pond for development.On July 23, the Attorney General\u2019s Chambers published a notice in the Federal Government Gazette announcing the proposed revocation of the Kepong land reservation for public purposes under Section 64(2) of the National Land Code for Lot 80810, measuring 16.65ha.It was signed by former chief secretary to the government Tan Sri Mohd Zuki Ali, whose service ended this month.Gazetted in 2016, Lot 80810 comprises Taman Tasik Intan Baiduri which is reserved for use as a recreation area.Residents living around Taman Tasik Intan Baiduri in Kepong worry losing this natural oasis. \u2014 Photos: FAIHAN GHANI, AZLINA ABDULLAH and YAP CHEE HONG/The StarIt is under the jurisdiction of Director General of the Federal Territories Department (JWP).When contacted, Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur Lands and Mines Office (PTGWP) stated that the degazettement was to allow for a bigger area to be gazetted as new land reserves.PTGWP deputy director (Land Registration sector) Mohd Firdaus Ibaruslan said the exercise was not related to any development project.ALSO READ: Do not touch land, says FT Minister\u201cThe degazettement needs to be done in order for us to regazette the plot according to the usage, from a recreational area of 16.65ha to new reserves.\u201cAltogether, we would degazette 16.65ha in order to regazette three reserves totalling 25.145ha,\u201d he said.He added that this would mean a retention pond reserve of 17.297ha, an open space reserve of 3.696ha and a nursery reserve of 4.152ha (see graphic).To put 16.65ha into perspective, it is equivalent to 28 football fields.Not the first timeThose living in and around the recreation area, including Intan Baiduri People\u2019s Housing Project (PPR) residents, worry that this could open up the area for development.This is the second time the government is attempting to initiate a degazettement process in the area.In 2021, PTGWP initiated similar degazettement of land adjacent to the lake (Lot 80835), which was reserved for public space.The land is sandwiched between the lake and Sungai Jinjang.The plan was for a mixed development project that would include an affordable housing scheme.The plan was halted by then Federal Territories minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa who emphasised that the land must not be touched.Taman Tasik Intan Baiduri serves as a water retention system to channels surface runoff from the surrounding area, as shown with this inlet, and a cherished recreational spot (below) for residents to enjoy fishing and connecting with nature.Intan Baiduri PPR Residents Association chairman Rashid Samad said it was disheartening to learn about the latest proposed degazettement.\u201cWe thought the matter had been settled when the revocation was cancelled in 2021.\u201cWhat is the purpose of degazetting just to regazette if there are no future plans to develop the area?\u201dRashid said the community was deeply concerned about the potential environmental and social impact if any development were to go through.\u201cWe have seen how rapidly Kuala Lumpur is losing green spaces and water bodies.\u201dIntan Baiduri PPR Block A chairman Khairul Anuwar Yusoff said there should be transparency about current and future plans for the entire area.\u201cWe did not even know that this proposal (to degazette) was happening as there was no notice.\u201cThere should be clear communication from the authorities to understand what is planned for our community,\u201d he said, adding that there were about 10,000 residents at the PPR.Precedent setSave Kuala Lumpur chairman Datuk M. Ali questioned the motives behind the plan as there was precedent of reserved land being developed.\u201cThis is the same old story that we keep hearing again and again from the government,\u201d he said.\u201cThey say that they are degazetting land to regazette it for bigger areas, but actually it\u2019s just a way for them to identify plots of land for development.\u201cA perfect example is Kampung Bohol pond.StarMetro article on Jan 27, 2021.\u201cThey degazetted it saying that it was to make it bigger, but now they are building houses on it.\u201cWe want transparency. We want to know what the real purpose is for them to do this.\u201dPreserve Kg Bohol Flood Retention Pond Coalition coordinator Datuk Ng See Eng said the exercise could open the door to other development in the area.\u201cI disagree with the government\u2019s decision to degazette Taman Tasik Intan Baiduri.Rashid says Kuala Lumpur has been rapidly losing green spaces and water bodies.\u201cAny government land meant for recreation and parks should remain so.\u201cDo not touch it. The city needs more green lungs and not skyscrapers.\u201dIn 2023, StarMetro reported that six plots of land surrounding Kampung Bohol pond had been alienated to a private developer for residential projects, including a Federal Territories Affordable Housing Project (Rumawip), Madani Housing and a condominium on three plots.The developer would be free to decide on the types of projects to construct on the remaining land plots.While the government later retracted the deal, it was revealed in April this year that new development plans had emerged for Kuala Lumpur\u2019s second-largest flood retention pond.Khairul Anuwar says there should be transparency about current and future plans for the entire area.On May 16, Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department (Federal Territories) Dr Zaliha Mustafa stated that the developer was required to upgrade the retention pond before receiving a development order for the alienated plots of land.In the meantime, Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng said he had inquired about the purpose for the degazettement of the Intan Baiduri recreation area.\u201cThis is a matter of significant public concern and I am currently awaiting a response from the authorities.\u201cFollowing the revocation notice for Taman Tasik Intan Baiduri, PTGWP is calling on the public to attend a hearing on the proposed cancellation on Aug 22, from 10am to 4pm, at the PTGWP office, second floor, Federal House in Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin.\u201cAnyone who wishes to object to the proposed cancellation can attend the inquiry and present their objections,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur Lands and Mines Office (PTGWP) has clarified how it arrived at the low sale price for plots of land at the Kampung Bohol flood retention pond.A PTGWP senior officer, who did not want to be named, said the premium for the six plots of land with a 99-year lease was calculated based on a formula given by the Valuation and Property Services Department (JPPH).\u201cThe calculation was based on a formula in Rule 8(b)(i) of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Land Rules 1995.StarMetro article on June 24.\u201cThe formula is \u00bc x land value x 1/99 x lease period.\u201cThere was no wrongdoing involved; we just used a gazetted formula that was endorsed by the government,\u201d the officer said.The officer acknowledged that the premium for the six plots was low, but added that it was also based on land approval conditions, market value from JPPH, land status and land location.On June 24, StarMetro\u2019s report titled \u201cLow price for Bohol land queried\u201d, saw PTGWP come under scrutiny for offering a low price for the land at Kampung Bohol flood retention pond.Residents of Kinrara in Puchong, Selangor, who live near Bohol pond, called for an explanation on the land deal, stating that the premium was below market value.In a press conference, Mohammed Nasser Yusof, acting as a lawyer for the residents, said the developer was to pay RM74 per sq ft for 10.1ha of land surrounding the pond.Nasser pointed out that based on the premium of RM41mil and the RM40mil cost to redevelop the pond, the figures were too low since Kampung Bohol land was valued at RM200 per sq ft or more.He claimed that the government would incur losses from the low price offered to the developer and requested that the government clarify the pricing criteria.Preserve Kampung Bohol Flood Retention Pond Coalition coordinator Datuk Ng See Eng said he was made aware of the formula used to calculate the premium by PTGWP deputy director (Land Registration sector) Mohd Firdaus Ibaruslan during a meeting held at the Parliament building on July 1.\u201cI was with Seputeh MP Teresa Kok, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof, Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department (Federal Territories) Dr Zaliha Mustafa and department heads from Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID) and PTGWP.\u201cThey all acknowledged that the price was too low and that it was time to revise the formula.\u201cIn addition, the prime minister had said that all sales of government land and projects must be carried out by open tender to get the best value and the best company to do the job to benefit the government.\u201cBut in this case, the government lost money, so what is the point in calling for an open tender if we are going to rely on an old formula?\u201d Ng said.When contacted, Kok confirmed that she attended a meeting on Monday to discuss the Bohol pond issue and the low price of the land there.\u201cYes, I have been made aware of the formula (for premium calculation),\u201d she said.\u201cBut I am sad to report that this project is going through despite our arguments.\u201cHowever, we are not going to let things go easily.\u201cWe will ensure that all the conditions are met and fulfilled by the developer regarding the Bohol flood retention pond upgrade.\u201cIt is the main condition that must be fulfilled before the housing project can take off.\u201dPrior to this, StarMetro reported that six plots of land surrounding the Bohol pond had been alienated for residential developments, including a Federal Territories Affordable Housing Project (Rumawip), Madani Housing and a condominium on three plots.The developer would be free to decide on the types of projects to construct on the remaining land plots.On May 16, Dr Zaliha stated that the developer was required to upgrade the retention pond before receiving a development order for the alienated plots of land.Upon checking with DBKL, no development order has been submitted yet by the developer.

Wan had only moved into the unit last month.She bought the unit for RM300,000 and received the keys in August 2020.Wan was currently in talks with her building management over the cost of damage and was hoping that the repairs would be completed as soon as possible.Meanwhile, about 28 vehicles were damaged during the same thunderstorm, after debris that had been ripped off the rooftops of Block C at the Kampung Muhhibah People\u2019s Housing Project (PPR), landed on them in the flat\u2019s parking lot.Thankfully, there were no injuries reported, but the damage to both the cars and the building\u2019s roof were significant, amounting to thousands of ringgit.T. Navindran, 31, recounted how his car was crushed by falling debris just after he had parked and exited the vehicle.\"I've suffered a financial loss, but I consider myself fortunate to have escaped unharmed,\" he said.A trader, identified only as Hajar, reported the loss of her canopy, tables, and chairs due to the strong winds.\"I am not the only one who lost everything, there are at least 20 traders operating in the PPR who also experienced similar losses,\" she said.PPR Kampung Muhibbah Resident Association chairman, Attar Bacha, expressed shock at the severity of the damage.\"While it's common for thunderstorms to cause damage to canopies and tables, the complete ripping off of the roof was just shocking,\" he said, adding that the association was currently assessing the extent of the building's damage.Seputeh MP Teresa Kok, who visited the site immediately after the incident, mobilised her own contractors to repair the roof and provided financial assistance of RM300 to each victim who lost their car in the incident.Kok explained that waiting for Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to allocate funds for repairs would take time, hence her proactive approach.\"Considering the seriousness of the case we acted quickly, and I also hope that DBKL will allocate more funds for the residents who lost their vehicles.\"Kok said that additionally, three schools \u2014 SK Bukit Jalil, SMK Bukit Jalil, and SMK Bandar Baru Seri Petaling which were also affected by the storm were allocated RM30,000 each for repair works from her own allocation.StarMetro attempted to reach out to DBKL for comments but did not receive a response at the time of press.

The project, to be spread over 36 months beginning from the signing of the contract between FLM and Perbadanan Putrajaya assuming all preconditions are met, would involve the integrated development of Residensi Cemara, Residensi Madani and 320 units of Residensi Wilayah in Putrajaya. FBG believes that the development contract is in the best interest of the group, anticipating it to contribute positively to the earnings and net assets of the group for the financial years ending June 30, 2025 and after. Beginning its operation in Malaysia in May 1976 as a turnkey contractor with principal activities in civil and infrastructure works as well as construction and property development, FBG is also involved in the plantation, trading and logistic sectors at present. Construction and property development remain the core of FBG\u2019s activities, with some of its completed projects including the Electrified Double Track from Seremban to Gemas, Skypark Hangar at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang, Tampin Hospital in Negeri Sembilan, Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT) at Sepang, the Depot and Traction Power Substation for Ampang LRT Line Extension Project, and the design and building of the 11-storey Medical Suite (Phase 1A) of Gleneagles Hospital. Among its more successful projects in the country are the Rica Residence Sentul, completed in early 2021 - which has been well-received by buyers due to its proximity to public transportation services such as the Light Rail Transit (LRT) and the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) 2 - and Vierra Residence Kinrara, launched in the second quarter of 2022, which is a two tower blocks development based on the affordable housing concept of Residensi Wilayah Keluarga Malaysia (RUMAWIP). FBG's latest local project Desa Green, located in Kuala Krai, Kelantan is an integrated township with a land area of approximately 146 acres. At the same time, Melbourne, Australia, the group completed Gardenhill, a luxury apartment development located in Melbourne, Australia, back in early 2017. More recently, FBG has also launched Paragon in early 2021, a skyscraper of residences also located in Melbourne, featuring Australia\u2019s first high-rise indoor forest. The Wilds is FBG's latest development launched in mid 2021, located in Northcote Melbourne, which is a designed collection of 15 houses on the banks of Merri Creek.",

Nga said the ministry was continuously seeking suitable and effective alternatives in the recovery of sick and abandoned private housing projects. This, he said, included regular monitoring and site visits to project sites, collaborating with agencies and local authorities to identify focused prevention or resolution methods together with developers as well as facilitating solutions for the recovery of sick private housing projects. \"The ministry has also issued confirmation letters for sick and abandoned private housing projects through a Housing Controller for house buyers who intend to terminate their sale and purchase agreements. \"Buyers may also engage legal services to proceed with the termination procedure. \"Simultaneously, the task force will also monitor, engage and discuss with developers to find solutions in expediting the projects' completion, which can only be successful with the support and commitment from both developers and buyers.\"",

A company official said pending final guidelines, it expects to finalise the project in three months. Meanwhile, checks with the Companies Commission of Malaysia showed that Platinum Victory was incorporated in July 2001 and has an issued share capital of RM10 million. Platinum Victory, in its latest financial year statement ended Dec 31 2022, reported a net profit of RM134,342 with zero revenue and RM11.56 million in current assets. On Thursday, the NST reported that a housing developer had committed RM40 million to \"upgrade\" the Kampung Bohol retention pond along the Kesas Highway as part of its winning bid for a housing project tender. Aside from the requirement to upgrade the retention pond, the developer would also fork out RM41.7 million for the premium of six plots of adjacent land measuring 10.84ha. This works out to around RM69 per sq ft. Details of what  will be built in the area, however, remain unclear. Residents, meanwhile, had questioned the rationale behind awarding prime land to the housing developer in exchange for the company's promise of deepening the pond for a mere RM40 million. They claimed that the area was already cramped with buildings and any new housing project would only lead to further congestion and other issues. The NST has also reported that while residents and elected representatives had voiced concerns following reports that the area would be developed, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Federal Territories) Dr Zaliha Mustafa  said the developer must comply with requirements for traffic and environmental impact assessments, among others. \"We assure the public that the upgrading of the pond would be completed first before any work on the housing project can start. \"Three of the six plots of land will be used for affordable housing \u2014 one for Residensi Madani and two for RumaWip,\" she told reporters at  a recent media briefing. The developer would be free to decide the types of residential properties it wanted to build on the three other plots, she was reported as saying.

Ng, who has lived in the area for the past 30 years, said with no rail services, the already nightmarish traffic would worsen. \"Traffic congestion will worsen in Puchong and Kinrara. We were told at least 5,000 residential units would be built in the area. \"Where will these people's children go to school? There are no hospitals there. Everyone will just end up in Puchong.\" Ng said if the six plots of land were developed, there would be no more room to expand the already congested Kesas Highway. Seputeh member of parliament Teresa Kok, under whose Parliamentary constituency the area falls, did not mince her words. \"The land should not be sold at all. I disagree with this decision. \"This is what happens when decisions are made in an air-conditioned room, without going to the ground.\" Kok added that she was not even informed of the decision and that she wasn't involved in the decision-making process. \"I wonder if they even consulted other elected representatives or the Subang Jaya City Council? All the traffic will go to Puchong.\" While the project has been awarded, residents will still have a chance to have their say at a public hearing on the matter on May 20. At the same time, Zaliha is also expected to meet affected residents next week.",

        "content": "sharen@nst.com.my KUALA LUMPUR: Radium Development Bhd will continue to offer new urban residences and reasonably priced homes that appeal to a variety of market segments. Datuk Gary Gan Kah Siong, the managing director of Radium, said the company is dedicated to offering high-quality housing solutions to fulfil the demands of Malaysians in all economic categories as a developer concentrating in Kuala Lumpur properties. According to him, the company's luxury R Suites Chancery Residences in Ampang, which debuted this year, has captured the attention of northern and Klang Valley real estate investors. He said the RM521 million project satisfies the needs of real estate investors who want to diversify their holdings in the hope of making money over the long run and who seek great quality and value from their assets. Radium also recently opened the sales gallery for its latest project, the 9.77-acre Desa East Residences development in Sungai Besi, Kuala Lumpur. Gan said that hundreds of people came to the sales gallery's launch eager to learn more about the project. \"The positive response we received towards Desa East Residences demonstrates that there is a huge demand for attractively priced and well-located projects, and is a testament to the purchasers' confidence in the Radium brand and product offerings,\" he said in a statement. Gan said this project is in line with the company's commitment to providing attainable homes in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur city, which coincides with the government's Madani aspirations of inclusive development for all Malaysians. With an expected completion date in the fourth quarter of 2027, he said Desa East presents an exciting opportunity for those seeking quality and attainable properties in a strategic location, offering seamless access to major roads, including the Sungai Besi Highway, SMART Expressway, MEX Highway, and Salak Expressway. Vista Adesa Residensi Wilayah offers 1,218 units under the Residensi Wilayah (also known as RUMAWIP) affordable housing scheme. These 800 square foot units, which offer roomy three-bedroom, two-bathroom arrangements and are priced at RM300,000 each, have proven popular with first-time homebuyers, according to Gan. He said more than 600 applications, or roughly 50 per cent have been submitted for the project, and their purchases are currently awaiting authorisation from the relevant authority. The 1,218 units in Radium Adesa Residence, with sizes ranging from 1,218 to 2,560 square feet, are geared towards urban residents who want larger floor plans and more spacious built-up houses in prime locations. Gan said this project's competitively priced RM388,000 asking price has also sparked the interest of buyers looking for high-quality residences at affordable costs. He said there has been a 70 per cent take-up rate, with the majority of buyers upgrading their current houses to larger units to take advantage of the prime location.",

The Prime Minister said the decision was made in line with the aspirations of MADANI Malaysia and will benefit homeowners who own properties under RUMAWIP, PRIMA, PPAM and Residensi Wilayah in Kuala Lumpur. Anwar said the assessment tax reduction will also result in the local council,  Kuala Lumpur City Hall losing about RM2.067 million in revenue. \"The reduction in the residential assessment tax for affordable homes in Kuala Lumpur will help reduce the cost of living of B40 and M40 citizens in the KL\", he said before officiating the car park with a signing gimmick at PPAM Metropolitan Kepong.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Lim Seong Hai Capital Bhd (LSH Capital) is undertaking a series of corporate proposals for its upstream integration expansion into property development and improving its fast-growing construction sector. The corporate proposals entail a combined acquisition value of RM157.6 million. The corporate exercises comprise the acquisition of a 100 per cent stake in Astana Setia Sdn Bhd (Astana Setia) via a share sale agreement for RM95 million. Astana Setia has an existing RM395.9 million gross domestic value (GDV) for its Residensi Laman Segar Hijau (LSH Segar) development project in Taman Segar, Cheras. Astana Setia's flagship LSH Segar project has secured 100 per cent uptake under the RUMAWIP affordable housing scheme and 70 per cent uptake among open units.  Astana Setia also has an external construction order book of RM390.81 million, of which RM146.82 million is still outstanding. LSH Capital has also executed an assets exchange agreement and debt settlement cum share subscription agreement with LSH Ventures Sdn Bhd (LSH Ventures) for RM62 million to be satisfied via new LSH Capital shares at 45 sen. This presents a premium of 7.14 per cent to 9.20 per cent over the closing market price on March 25, 2022, and a volume-weighted average price of six months. The transaction with LSH Ventures involves the acquisition of four parcels of lands and buildings on-site in attractive locations across Kuala Lumpur, Kajang and Johor Bahru for RM8.14 million. In addition, LSH Capital will settle approximately RM54 million due to LSH Venture directors. Upon completion, LSH Capital will own 99 per cent in LSH Ventures and will have 93.75 per cent effective interest in Astana Setia and Euro Saga Sdn Bhd. In addition, LSH Capital is also involved in construction and property development projects amounting to RM2.7 billion via the BEST Framework collaboration. This collaboration will enable the company to earn a specific portion in fees for various value creation efforts. Upon completing the proposals, LSH Capital will have an enlarged secured construction order book amounting to RM1.1 billion in aggregate. The company has an overall outstanding orderbook of RM782.0 million. It also carries a property development project with a gross development value (GDV) of RM1.59 billion, which is expected to provide earnings visibility until 2026. LSH Capital said the company would also seek shareholder approval to expand its core businesses, including property and construction-related businesses. These new integrated upstream businesses are expected to contribute more than 25 per cent of the company's net profit moving forward. LSH Capital's expansion of its property development venture allows it to synergise better with the operations currently undertaken by Lim Seong Hai Lighting Sdn Bhd and Knight Auto Sdn Bhd, subsidiaries of LSH Capital. This will further expand the construction business together with the inclusion of property development and property investment, which will allow the company to achieve significant involvement in the supply chains in the construction industry. \"This is in line with the BEST Framework adopted by LSH Capital to transform the core foundation of the construction industry,\" it added.",

        "content": "Platinum Victory's three new launches in 2020 saw up to 90 per cent take-up rate, thanks to positive growth in the second half of the year, says its executive director Gan Yee Hin. Gan said the high take-up rate generally reflected an uptrend industry-wide, driven by steady demand and supply for affordable housing among first-time house buyers. The conversion rate combining the take-up of properties from within the three projects was 50 per cent, he said in a statement. Gan said in view of the current pandemic situation, the conversion rate has been gradual as financiers and lenders had adopted a cautiously optimistic approach and imposed stringent loan criteria for housing loan facilities. The three projects launched last year are Vista Sentul Residences, Vista Danau Kota Residensi Wilayah, and MH Platinum 2 Residences. Their combined gross development value (GDV) is RM1.23 billion.   In 2019, the developer launched two projects namely Platinum Arena Residences in Old Klang Road, and PV9 Residences in Setapak, and they are fully sold out. Gan said the two projects were sold out last year, despite it being a tough market for all developers. Platinum Arena Residences, with a GDV of RM421 million, is a mixed-development comprising 728 units of serviced apartments, which sold at an average price of RM617 per square ft (psf). PV9 Residences, with an estimated GDV of RM539 million, comprises 953 units of serviced apartments with built-ups from 1,000 sq ft to 1,300 sq ft. The selling price is from RM530,000. The project also features 438 units of affordable housing under the Residensi Wilayah scheme (RUMAWIP), selling at RM300,000. Gan said it is important to roll out property projects that meet the increasing needs and demands of those with a budget but aiming for prime locations within Klang Valley. \"We understand their market needs without compromising on the fundamentals of location, value for money, convenience, and accessibility,\" he said. Up-coming launches Gan said Platinum Victory will develop more value-for-money and affordable homes in the Klang Valley. The projects include Vista Saujana, a low-density project with 200 units, and Vista Dedanau, which is set aside as housing for the civil service workforce (Perumahan Penjawat Awam Malaysia \u2013 PPAM). Besides the affordable scheme, the developer will focus on competitively-priced lower density developments this year, such as Platinum Casa Danau. To further strengthen its position, Platinum Victory is collaborating with Jakel Group to develop J.Satine \u2013 a mixed development project in Setapak. J.Satine will encompass Residensi Wilayah and SoHo residential units, as well as commercial units. \"The market for new homeownership especially among millennials, young families, and new house buyers continues to grow steadily and drive demand for affordable housing here. We want to continue to meet the demand for good quality homes in prime locations,\" Gan said. This year the developer will also unveil The Ark by Platinum Victory, a 12-acre community-based hub in Setapak. The Ark by Platinum Victory will also feature the Key Moments Office, a centralised key collection centre by Platinum Victory. Gan said it aims to redefine property handovers, where customers can collect their house keys upon project completion. Among offerings at The Ark by Platinum Victory include a slew of interior design and home improvement solutions.",

Its like a single-storey terrace house with a garden, but what we have overlooks the pool.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Former Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor today argued that the prosecution in his corruption trial had failed to rebut evidence that the RM2 million payment he received was actually a political donation. His lawyer Datuk Tan Hock Chuan said witnesses, including the investigation officer in the case, had testified that the money which the accused received from a property tycoon was a political donation for Umno. He said the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigation officer Muhamad Saad Bordani agreed that his investigation showed the money was a political donation for expenses incurred by Umno in by-elections. Tan said Saad, who was the 23rd prosecution witness, had also confirmed that both Aset Kayamas managing director Tan Sri Chai Kin Kong and Tengku Adnan informed him about this when their statements were recorded. He said the political donation was issued for Umno expenses in two by-elections in Kuala Kangsar, Perak and Sungai Besar, Selangor, respectively. \"In his (Chai's) statement, the witness also confirmed that the sum of RM2 million was a political donation to Umno and not for the accused. \"It is very important to note that the witness was not re-examined regarding this evidence. \"Failure by the prosecution to re-examine on this issue amounts to an acceptance of the witness's testimony,\" he said during his submission at the end of the defence stage of the trial today. Tan said the accused had informed Chai that Umno would need about RM5 million for the two by-elections but the tycoon did not promise to donate any amount at that time. \"The accused testified on oath that Chai subsequently informed him that he would donate a sum of RM2 million but he required a little time to raise the funds. \"The accused informed Chai that he would use his own money in advance for the expenses for both by-elections as time was short,\" Tan said. Meanwhile, Tan said Tadmansori Holding Sdn Bhd (Tadmansori) chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Hasbi Jaafar had testified that the accused also informed him that the money was a political donation. Tan said Mohd Hasbi said he received a WhatsApp text from the accused showing the deposit slip of the RM2 million from Aset Kayamas to Tandmansori. \"He was told by the accused that the RM2 million cheque was a political donation for the Sungai Besar and Kuala Kangsar by-elections,\" he said. He also stressed that the prosecution failed to prove a key element in the charge that the RM2 million was paid to the accused for himself. Tengku Adnan is charged with accepting RM2 million from Chai, whom he knew had connection with his official function, via a cheque belonging to Aset Kayamas, which was deposited into a bank account belonging to Tadmansori Holding, in which the accused had interest. He allegedly committed the offence in his capacity as a public servant, which was the Federal Territories minister at the time, at CIMB Bank Bhd, Pusat Bandar Damansara branch, level 1, Lot A4, Block A, Pusat Bandar Damansara, here on June 14, 2016. Aset Kayamas was set up in 2011, with a primary focus of delivering homes that were founded on quality and affordability. Its expanding portfolio featured various luxury residential development projects such as Park Hill in Bukit Jalil, The Henge in Kepong and The Holmes in Bandar Tun Razak. It has also worked on several affordable public housing projects across the Klang Valley in collaboration under the Perumahan Penjawat Awam 1Malaysia (PPA1M) and Rumawip schemes.

        "title": "Rising costs: A multifaceted challenge",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Affordable housing remains a critical challenge in Malaysia, particularly for the B40 and M40 income groups. Homeownership is increasingly difficult for these groups. Experts note that the real cost of affordable housing includes not just construction but also economic pressures on developers and financial constraints on buyers. Finding a middle ground requires innovative construction, government incentives, and a broad economic understanding. The government has introduced programmes like PR1MA and Rumah Selangorku. However, demand still exceeds supply. In urban areas like the Klang Valley, there are 1,000 to 6,000 applicants per unit. This imbalance necessitates examining the root causes of the affordability crisis and bridging the gap between developers and buyers. Chief commercial officer and property valuer Chai Wai Seen explains that multiple factors contribute to the rising costs of affordable housing, primarily stemming from various development expenses. \"There are many components in the costs of developing a property development project, including land cost, construction costs, compliance costs, consultant fees, and financing costs.\" \"After Covid-19, there was a significant increase in construction costs due to inflation, disruption in the global supply chain, and depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit,\" he added. These cost pressures have a twofold impact where, on one side, developers face squeezed profit margins. \"Developers' margins were affected when the development costs increased and the competitive market situation restricted price hikes for condominiums and serviced apartments,\" he said. On the other side, increasing construction and living costs mean that the target market\u2014primarily the B40 and M40 segments\u2014is hit hard, diminishing their purchasing power. Juwai IQI co-founder and group chief executive officer Kashif Ansari said that last year, climbing cement and steel prices raised home construction costs by 5 per cent to 10 per cent. \"These hikes trigger a chain reaction, escalating project expenses and potentially affecting final home prices.\" He further pointed out that although Malaysia benefits from relatively controlled construction costs compared to other ASEAN countries, the intrinsic cost structure\u2014with construction accounting for 50 per cent of new housing expenses\u2014still leaves developers with little margin to manoeuvre. Strategies for Developers: Balancing Profitability and Affordability Developers continuously face the challenge of maintaining profitability while delivering affordable housing. Chai said that in order to maintain profit margins, developers must either increase project revenues or find ways to reduce costs. One viable solution he offered is adopting the industrialised building system (IBS) for mass production of affordable units. \"The government can also reduce compliance costs to assist developers in maintaining profitability,\" he remarks, though he concedes that these approaches come with their own challenges. Meanwhile, Kashif outlined additional strategic measures, stating, \"Developers can use government incentives to build more affordably and they can cross-subsidise affordable units with luxury homes as well as adopt innovative construction techniques to manage costs.\" By utilising advanced construction methods\u2014such as modular techniques and prefabrication\u2014the industry could reduce expenses and accelerate project timelines. Kashif compares this approach to an Ikea flat-pack box, symbolising a shift toward more efficient and cost-effective housing production. Affordability, however, is not solely defined by construction costs. Bank Islam Malaysia chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said that the broader economic context plays a pivotal role. \"The principle of cost to build an affordable house would be the same as in the mainstream market,\" he explains, noting that when building material costs rise, profit margins shrink. He emphasises that affordability hinges on purchasing power\u2014not just housing prices. \"Income has to increase and the prices of other goods and services should not rise excessively,\" he asserts. Dr Afzanizam also suggests that the promotion of a rental housing market could serve as an interim solution, enabling households to save up before venturing into homeownership. However, for this approach to succeed, a well-regulated environment must protect both renters and property owners, ensuring that rental rates remain fair and that the upkeep of properties is maintained. On the policy front, Chai and Kashif advocate for proactive government intervention. Chai warns of the oversupply of high-rise developments and calls for a study to ensure affordable housing meets its intended targets rather than adding to market saturation. Kashif proposes concrete measures such as subsidising construction materials, offering discounted financing for affordable housing projects, and forming purchasing consortia to leverage economies of scale\u2014a strategy that could reduce material costs by up to 30 per cent.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Corruption Watch (MCW) has expressed deep concern over the findings revealed in the latest Auditor General's Report. The watchdog said the findings highlighted governance failures, poor oversight, and a lack of financial accountability, in particular that 40 per cent of 217 federal government subsidiaries reported losses amounting RM218 billion and 21 subsidiaries suffered losses for three consecutive years in 2023. \"This situation clearly reflects systemic weaknesses in governance and ineffective financial monitoring. The absence of early corrective measures and timely intervention shows that the existing regulatory mechanisms are not functioning effectively,\" said MCW president Jais Abdul Karim when contacted by the New Straits Times. He said that if this situation persisted, it would not only waste public funds but also erode public trust in government financial management. He also stressed the need for greater transparency in financial reporting. \"Many government subsidiaries fail to provide clear and detailed financial disclosures, which makes monitoring more difficult. The government must mandate stricter financial disclosures and ensure all subsidiaries undergo regular independent audits to prevent mismanagement and financial leakage,\" he added. To prevent continued losses, Jais urged the government to implement immediate reforms. These reforms, he said, should include appointing qualified and high-integrity individuals to lead government-linked companies (GLCs), mandating annual independent audits with strict enforcement, and introducing policies to close or restructure underperforming companies within a set timeframe. \"The accountability of board members and management must be strengthened to ensure they are responsible for every decision made,\" he added. Jais also called for legal action against individuals responsible for repeated losses. \"Anyone found responsible must face legal consequences, including investigations into possible elements of misappropriation and abuse of power. Enforcement mechanisms such as the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and the National Audit Department must be empowered to ensure accountability in managing public funds. \"As a nation that prioritises integrity and transparency in public financial management, the failure of government subsidiaries cannot continue without firm action. MCW urges the government to take immediate reform measures to ensure that GLCs are more competitive, transparent, and accountable to the people,\" he said. Earlier, Auditor General Datuk Wan Suraya Wan Mohd Radhi, in a statement regarding the report tabled in Parliament, revealed that five federal agencies now had more liabilities than assets, including Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia (PR1MA) and the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp). She also highlighted that five federal agencies had recorded the highest consecutive losses over three years, with Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), and Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) among the top three. Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), M. Kulasegaran said that a total of 12,393 cases had been identified following audits of government agencies, which were being investigated by the police, the MACC, and Public Service Department (PSD) committees.",

In a statement on the report, AG Datuk Wan Suraya Wan Mohd Radhi said an audit of 142 agencies found they had assets of RM2.6 trillion and liabilities of RM871 billion. According to the full report, the increase is at RM0.184 trillion (7.3 per cent) compared to the total assets in 2022, which stood at RM2.512 trillion. \"Meanwhile, the total liabilities in 2023 for 142 Federal Agencies amounted to RM0.871 trillion, a decrease of RM0.014 trillion (1.6 per cent) compared to RM0.885 trillion in 2022. \"An audit analysis comparing assets and liabilities found that 137 Federal Agencies had total assets exceeding their total liabilities, while five Federal Agencies had higher total liabilities than total assets. \"Among these agencies were Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia (PR1MA) and the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp),\" it said. It said PR1MA had a net liability of RM342.46 million due to loan funds (Sukuk) that must be settled by 2027 and could not be covered by existing assets. As for SWCorp, its net liability amounted to RM140.15 million, primarily due to high concessionaire company payables and accrued expenses compared to its available assets. The audit also found that 20 agencies took loans amounting to RM126.5 billion from the government and financial institutions. In 2023, four agencies took out new loans totalling RM7.3 billion. \"The audit analysis also found that two out of the four Federal Agencies\u2014namely, the Armed Forces Fund Board (LTAT) and the Malaysian Timber Industry Board (MTIB)\u2014received financing from the Federal Government amounting to RM0.280 billion (3.8 per cent).

        "title": "Malaysia's property market resilient and stable throughout 2024: Juwai IQI",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's housing market, and by extension the property sector, remained resilient and stable throughout 2024, supported by brisk demand and new projects, reflecting investor confidence. According to the Malaysian House Price Index, the average home price stood at RM475,126, with a modest 0.4 per cent rise from a year ago, underscoring the market's stability amid global economic uncertainties. Juwai IQI co-founder and group chief executive officer (CEO) Kashif Ansari told Bernama that residential properties played a pivotal role. \"Residential transactions accounted for 50 per cent of the total value and 63 per cent of the volume of all real estate transactions so far this year,\" he said. Optimism among developers was palpable, with over 32,000 new landed and high-rise homes initiated in the third quarter (3Q)\u2014a substantial 50 per cent jump from 2Q. Kashif added that developers are not only starting new projects but also delivering completed houses steadily, ensuring a balance between supply and demand. \"The market maintained a measured pace of growth, signalling confidence and the potential for continued expansion,\" he said. The data reflects a year of measured progress for Malaysia's property market, setting a strong foundation as the sector heads into 2024, Kashif said. \"They delivered nearly 24,000 homes in 3Q 2024, similar to the previous quarter, Kashif told Bernama. Juwai IQI expects the housing market to remain relatively stable in 4Q, he said. A predictable market with stable rates and prices makes it easier for consumers to research their purchases, he said. According to National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) data, 3Q 2024 reported slight increases in both volume and value of housing transactions, with 70,520 units recorded (3Q 2023: 68,561 units) worth RM28.74 billion versus RM28.36 billion a year ago. Overall, the property market performance strengthened with the number and transaction value expanding by 3.1 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively. This comprises 112,305 transactions valued at RM57.31 billion, against 108,993 transactions worth RM57.14 in 3Q 2023. Valuation and Property Services Department (JPPH) Director-General Abdul Razak Yusak said 3Q 2024's improved performance was due to positive growth in transaction numbers in all subsectors. Additionally, the momentum in the unsold complete units, known as overhang properties, eased to 21,968 units valued at RM13.85 billion versus 22,642 units worth RM14.24 billion in 2Q 2024. Despite ongoing global economic challenges, Abdul Razak said several infrastructure projects are expected to catalyse economic growth and stimulate the property market. This includes the Rapid Transit Link (RTS) project in Johor, industrial projects in the northern region, the Pan Borneo Highway in Sabah and Sarawak, and the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).  Government's Efforts on Affordable Housing To boost home ownership, the Housing and Local Government Ministry implemented various initiatives, including the Housing Credit Guarantee Scheme, whereby the government guarantees financing up to RM500,000 for first-time homebuyers, targeting those without a fixed income and those from low- to middle-income groups. Additionally, the Home Ownership Campaign 2.0 offers stamp duty exemptions on transfer and financing agreements for first-time buyers of units valued up to RM500,000 until Dec 31, 2025. Its minister, Nga Kor Ming, reported that a total of 25,903 housing units under the National Housing Corporation (SPNB) were sold as of Sept 30, with young people owning 19,909 units, or 76.9 per cent. He also noted that 44,983 units, or 65 per cent of the 69,205 affordable housing units, were owned by youths. Additionally, 25,030 of 41,671 units, or 60.1 per cent of affordable PR1MA units, were owned by young people, excluding PR1MA joint venture projects.  Addressing Challenges While building affordable housing remained a focus for most developers, they said rising costs ranging from a few per cent to 15 per cent from a year ago and higher financing costs have squeezed margins. The increase is especially significant for earthworks and infrastructure-related materials. Rising transportation and supply chain-related costs have also led to higher development costs. The rise in the sales and service tax (SST) to eight per cent, implemented earlier this year from six per cent, caused further hardships. Property companies navigated a mixed landscape with moderate growth, balancing cost pressures and cautious demand in the residential sector this year while commercial properties showed signs of recovery but face longer-term structural challenges. Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association (Rehda) Malaysia president Datuk Ho Hon Sang said that based on its survey, 84 per cent of respondents were impacted by economic conditions in the first half (1H) of 2024. This prompted them to implement cost-cutting measures that include freezing recruitment, reducing staff benefits, and delaying or scaling down project launches. Despite this, Ho said 44 per cent of respondents planned to launch projects in 2H 2024, focusing primarily on landed properties, which continue to see higher demand versus high-rise developments. To boost sales, developers would offer assistance with down payments (covering the first 10 per cent), increase their use of digital marketing and virtual technologies, and provide discounts to buyers, averaging eight per cent.",

Datuk Andansura Rabu (Pas-Beserah) said the state government's commitment to building and providing housing units for lower-income groups across the state appears to have hit a snag when some buyers sub-let the units to a third party. \"Two days ago, someone shared with me several advertisements for PR1MA units put up for sale and even made into homestays. There appear to be some weaknesses in the screening and selection of buyers,\" he disclosed during his speech in support of the state budget bill at the Wisma Sri Pahang assembly today. Later, Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail stood up to clarify that there is a 10-year moratorium for the resale of PR1MA units in Pahang, which he introduced three years ago. \"Maybe, the Beserah assemblyman can go through the requirements for PR1MA buyers and the moratorium for buyers... what the buyers (reselling their units) are doing is wrong and I hope the housing exco (Pahang Local Government, Housing, Environment and Green Technology Committee chairman Datuk Mohammad Fakhruddin Mohd Ariff) can take action,\" he said. Meanwhile, Fakhruddin said PR1MA houses sold at RM150,000 each were subsidised by the state government and received huge demand. \"Some individuals might have entered a side agreement with the buyers for 10 years and this is an offence. We will revoke the unit ownership if the owners do not abide by the regulations. They are misusing (sub-letting to a third party) the government's assistance,\" he said. Andansura said that his major concern is that there were weaknesses in the selection process where aspiring PR1MA unit buyers have to apply online, and those with a household income of about RM10,000 and below are entitled to be considered for the units. When met, Andansura said there were those who resold the RM150,000 PR1MA units for between RM230,000 and RM260,000 each, and some were doing homestay businesses. \"The Pahang government has to review the PR1MA housing selection process.

Kashif told NST Property that the new RM13 billion promises to be another tool in the toolbox for solving the problem of housing. \"With good affordable housing, families can have the stability they need to work, send their kids to school, and save money.

He pointed out that while Malaysia's overall homeownership rate stands at about 76 per cent, it is only 47 per cent among civil servants. \"There's a gap to bridge. The RM13 billion initiative can contribute significantly, but solving such a large-scale issue requires a multi-pronged approach. A young couple in Kuala Lumpur will have different needs than a family in Sabah,\" he said. Kashif added that existing initiatives like the Malaysian Civil Servants Housing Programme (PPA1M), Perumahan Rakyat 1Malaysia (PR1MA), Residensi Wilayah, Rumah Selangorku, My First Home Scheme, and BSN MyHome already play a role in addressing housing needs. Meanwhile, Dr. Oh Si Eun, principal adviser at the Pacific Research Centre, offered a cautious perspective. He noted that while the RM13 billion initiative could stabilise housing prices in the long term, it might also inadvertently lower property values in some segments. \"Both scenarios can happen, but that is inevitable, as mass low-cost housing would typically drive down property prices in general while making it more affordable for the low-income earners. The question is whether there are effective programmes to cushion the fall for existing owners,\" Oh said. Dr. Oh stressed the importance of enforcement for the project's success. \"Very often the debt collection is neglected and subsidised loans are not new and sometimes go repaid. Rent-to-own is one possible idea,\" he said.",

        "content": "SHAH ALAM: Construction of the Harmoni MADANI People's Residency Programme (PRR) in Bestari Jaya, Kuala Selangor, is set to begin early next year and is expected to be completed within two years, the Selangor state legislative assembly was told today. State Housing and Culture Committee chairman Datuk Borhan Aman Shah said planning approval for the 245 housing units was granted by the Kuala Selangor Municipal Council (MPKS) on Oct 28, subject to compliance with conditions set for the implementing agency, Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia (PR1MA). The agency will submit its building plan approval application soon. \"The Harmoni MADANI PRR project includes 245 single-storey terrace houses with three bedrooms, one bathroom, and a proposed lot size of 20 feet by 60 feet. \"However, the finalised housing design will be determined after building plan approval from MPKS. Each unit is priced at RM45,000 and will be offered to verified former plantation workers,\" he said in a written reply, read out by Selangor Infrastructure and Agriculture Committee chairman Izham Hashim during the assembly. Borhan was responding to a question from Pang Sock Tao (PH-Kuala Kubu Bharu) regarding the status of the 245 PRR units meant for plantation workers from five estates in Bestari Jaya - Ladang Minyak, Ladang Sungai Tinggi, Ladang Mary, Ladang Nigel Gardner and Ladang Bukit Tagar. He added that the project was jointly agreed upon by the Selangor and Federal governments through the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT), with a total development cost of RM75 million. \"This follows the 13th Selangor State Executive Council (MMKN) meeting held on May 10 2024, which approved in principle, the housing solution proposal for former workers of Berjaya City estates. The RM75 million funding includes RM40 million from KPKT and RM35 million from the Selangor government,\" Borhan said. KPKT Minister Nga Kor Ming had announced on May 3 that the housing issues affecting 245 families from five estates in Bestari Jaya, Kuala Selangor would be resolved soon. The families had been grappling with housing challenges for decades after being evicted without proper homes. Three days later, Nga confirmed the project's construction, aimed at addressing the housing problems faced by the rubber estate settlers. The project will be developed on an 8.09-hectare plot at Lot 25, Ladang Sungai Tinggi, through a collaboration between the Selangor government and Berjaya Corporation Berhad, which is providing the land free of charge.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: The government's proactive measures in the 2025 Budget showcase a strong commitment to supporting first-time homebuyers in Malaysia, said Kenneth Soh, Country Manager for Malaysia at PropertyGuru and iProperty. He noted that affordability remains a major concern, and the government's allocation of RM900 million for the People's Residence Programme (PRR) and Rumah Mesra Rakyat (RMR) projects is a timely initiative. This move, expected to benefit nearly 17,500 new residents, directly addresses the financial challenges faced by first-time homebuyers, he said. Soh highlighted findings from PropertyGuru's H1 2024 Consumer Sentiment Study, which revealed that the 1Malaysia Housing Programme (PR1MA) was viewed as the most beneficial housing initiative, followed by Rumah Selangorku and Projek Perumahan Rakyat (PPR). \"We believe the continued allocation towards affordable housing schemes reinforces the critical need to provide more affordable housing options in a market where inflation, rising interest rates, and the cost of living continue to impact the ability of many Malaysians to purchase their first home,\" he said. He also emphasised the importance of the RM12.8 billion allocation for the House Credit Guarantee Scheme (SJKP), which aims to support 57,000 first-time buyers. This expanded scheme increases financial accessibility for individuals with limited financial history or lower incomes, helping them qualify for home loans. The study found that 44% of first-time buyers struggle to save for down payments, further highlighting the impact of inflation and rising costs on homeownership. Soh explained that enhanced support under SJKP is crucial in helping first-time buyers secure homes. Additionally, the Step Up Financing Scheme under SJKP, which offers lower loan repayments for the first five years, is specifically designed to reduce the financial burden on young Malaysians and first-time homebuyers. Soh pointed out that high interest rates remain a significant obstacle for many potential homeowners, with 40% of respondents citing it as a major challenge in managing mortgage payments. \"These initiatives collectively reflect the government's commitment to enabling more Malaysians to overcome the hurdles of home financing and achieve their homeownership aspirations,\" he said. The government also introduced income tax relief on home loan interest payments, offering up to RM7,000 for properties priced at RM500,000 or below and RM5,000 for properties between RM500,000 and RM750,000. \"As many Malaysians are looking for ways to ease their financial burden, our study revealed that 50 per cent of respondents expressed a strong desire for increased government support through affordable housing schemes and financial subsidies. This relief aligns with the urgent need for supportive measures in the housing market,\" Soh said. \"It reflects the government's responsiveness to the challenges faced by potential homeowners and reinforces their commitment to creating a more accessible and affordable housing landscape in Malaysia.\"",

Also present was UniMAP vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Zaliman Sauli.Nanta said this when asked to comment on whether the Works Ministry had plans to replace concrete or metal road barriers with shock-absorbing materials to prevent fatal accidents.Nanta said, for example, on the Karak Highway in hilly areas, a 'roller barrier' type road barrier is used, which is a composite component that is not rigid, but it cannot be used in all areas as some areas have to use concrete barriers.Meanwhile, he said his ministry, as the implementing agency, has taken note of the Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's directive regarding the reconstruction of Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Chuping and Sekolah Sukan Malaysia Perlis, which have been stalled for the past 12 years.\"These projects are still at the Education Ministry's level (since they involve schools), and when the time comes, (if) they are sent to us, we will follow up with the appropriate actions as the implementer,\" he said.On April 27, Anwar ordered the reconstruction of SK Chuping to begin this year, while the school project must be immediately handed over to a capable government company during the chairing of the Special State Development Meeting with the Chief Minister and the line-up of state and federal government leadership at the Perlis State Development Office.Meanwhile, in a Works Ministry media statement, Nanta mentioned that there were three main projects at UniMAP, namely the construction of the UniMAP Mosque and Islamic Centre Project, UniMAP Grand Hall Project, and UniMAP Engineering Study Centre Project.Nanta said the construction project of the mosque and Islamic centre was scheduled to be completed in August, while the UniMAP Grand Hall was expected to be completed in July, while the UniMAP Engineering Study Centre was slated for completion in October next year.- Bernama\u00a0",

In addition to economic data, we also provide social, environmental, and detailed data from parliamentary to state assembly levels, indirectly assisting the government in planning more targeted development and economic projects,\" Mohd Uzir said in a special interview.He said the OpenDOSM initiative has successfully bridged the information gap between policymakers and the public.By offering an accessible and user-friendly data platform, OpenDOSM strengthens the ability of policymakers and researchers to make evidence-based decisions.\"The platform's recognition has extended beyond Malaysia's borders. Countries like Qatar have shown interest in our approach, and I have been invited to share our experience and best practices in implementing OpenDOSM,\" he said.Asked about the factors contributing to Malaysia's success in the latest Odin assessment, Mohd Uzir credited the commitment and passion of DOSM personnel in promoting public awareness and data literacy. This, he said, led to strategic reforms focused on improving data coverage and openness.\"A special task force was established to address identified gaps, with particular attention given to gender-based data and district-level statistics,\" he said.He added that the newly announced assessment methodology by Open Data Watch (ODW) for Odin 2024/25 also spurred DOSM to prioritise the publication of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-related data, as it is a key component in the scoring system.To sustain Malaysia's performance in future assessments, Mohd Uzir said DOSM has implemented an Odin Self-Assessment Dashboard to monitor real-time progress on data coverage and openness.Among the key enhancements to OpenDOSM is the integration of the Advanced Release Calendar (ARC), synchronised with DOSM's official portal, to help users access the latest information on DOSM publications.Additionally, OpenDOSM now offers an email subscription feature that notifies users when new datasets are published.\"DOSM remains committed to strengthening Malaysia's open data agenda to ensure continued relevance at both national and global levels,\" he said.The Odin report, published biennially, evaluates the openness and coverage of official national statistics based on the availability of key indicators, disaggregation by time and geography, and accessibility in machine-readable formats.Odin aims to promote transparency, accountability, and evidence-based development through the use of high-quality data. \u2014 Bernama",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's inflation increased at a slower rate of 1.8 per cent in 2024 versus 2.5 per cent in 2023, with the index points standing at 132.8 in 2024\u00a0against 130.4 recorded in the previous year, said the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM).In a statement today, it said the country's inflation is in line with global inflation, which was recorded at 5.7 per cent in 2024, slower than the 6.6 per cent posted in 2023, citing the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook Database, April 2025.\"Along with the strengthening of the ringgit and the decline in global commodity prices, the government initiatives to regulate the prices of goods and services, as well as subsidies for certain items, to a certain extent, have curbed Malaysia's inflation from rising further,\" it said.Chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin highlighted that inflation for all groups recorded increases in 2024 except for information and communication (-1.5 per cent), and clothing and footwear (-0.3 per cent).\"The slower increase in Malaysia's inflation was driven by the restaurants and accommodation services (3.1 per cent); food and beverages (2.0 per cent); health (1.8 per cent); education (1.5 per cent); transport (1.0 per cent) and furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance group (0.7 per cent).\"Meanwhile, the housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (3.0 per cent); personal care, social protection and miscellaneous goods and services (3.0 per cent); recreation, sports and culture (1.8 per cent); alcoholic beverages and tobacco (0.7 per cent) and insurance and financial services group (0.3 per cent) recorded a higher increase as compared to the previous year,\"\u00a0he said.Mohd Uzir said that inflation for housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels recorded a significant increase, although headline inflation moderated in 2024.This was due to the rise in sewerage services charges by Indah Water Konsortium in January 2024 that offset higher operational costs, he said.\"The increase in this group was also driven by the adjustment of water supply service tariffs by the government through the National Water Services Commission, which involved an average increase of 22 cents per cubic metre for domestic users in Peninsular Malaysia and Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan, effective Feb 1, 2024,\" he added.In the meantime, the chief statistician said a slower increase in inflation of transport was mainly contributed by the subgroup of purchase of vehicles, which moderated to 0.1 per cent in 2024 as compared to 1.4 per cent in the preceding year.However, inflation for the subgroup of operation of personal transport equipment was higher in 2024 at 1.3 per cent (2023: 0.8 per cent) -- attributed to the implementation of targeted diesel subsidies effective June 10, 2024, by the government to control the leakages of subsidised diesel, he noted.Commenting on the inflation at the state level, the chief statistician explained that most states registered a slower increase in inflation, with four states exceeding the national inflation rate of 1.8 per cent in 2024, namely Penang (3.0 per cent), Pahang (2.4 per cent), Sarawak (2.4 per cent) and Selangor (2.1 per cent).\u00a0Meanwhile, Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan recorded the lowest increase at 0.7 per cent.\u00a0\"All states recorded a slower increase in the inflation of the food and beverages group in 2024,\"\u00a0he noted.\u00a0Meanwhile, commenting on inflation in ASEAN countries, Mohd Uzir said the inflation rate ranged from negative 0.4 per cent to 23.1 per cent in 2024, with Lao PDR recording the highest inflation at 23.1 per cent, while Brunei Darussalam recorded the lowest inflation at negative 0.4 per cent.\"Five countries registered an inflation rate higher than Malaysia (1.8 per cent), namely Lao PDR, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia.\"Meanwhile, Cambodia, Thailand and Brunei Darussalam recorded inflation rates lower than Malaysia,\" he added. - Bernama\u00a0",

        "content": "IN the wake of Sarawak\u2019s catastrophic floods, WWF-Malaysia warns that climate change and unchecked development are pushing the state to a tipping point.\u201cThe surge in extreme weather isn\u2019t random \u2013 it\u2019s a collision of global heating and poor land planning,\u201d said Lavanya Rama Iyer, the organisation\u2019s policy and climate change director.\u201cWhen land is paved, rainwater can\u2019t seep into the soil. Runoff overwhelms drains, heightening flash flood risks.\u201dSarawak\u2019s plight mirrors global trends.A 2020 Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia study found that land conversion and mismanagement have stripped forests and wetlands of their natural capacity to absorb rainfall.Meanwhile, temperatures here have climbed by 0.13\u00b0C per decade since 1969, while sea levels creep up 2.9mm yearly \u2013 accelerating coastal inundation.\u201cCommunities already feel the strain: longer deluges, fiercer floods and stagnant waters in lowlands,\u201d said Cynthia Chin, head of WWF-Malaysia\u2019s Sarawak Programme.Rainfall has surged 17% since 1970, according to the National Hydraulic Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM), with monsoons growing erratic. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t distant \u2013 it\u2019s drowning livelihoods now,\u201d she added.While levees and drains remain critical, WWF argues that nature itself must become Sarawak\u2019s frontline defence.\u201cMangroves buffer coasts; upstream forests soak up rain. These solutions are cheaper, smarter, and boost biodiversity,\u201d said Chin.Restoring the Rajang River\u2019s degraded tributaries, for instance, could curb sedimentation and slow runoff \u2013 a win for ecosystems and flood resilience.The group points to Long Semadoh, a remote highland settlement where, since 2017, indigenous communities and hydrologists have stabilised the upper Trusan River\u2019s banks using traditional knowledge and modern science.Villagers in Puneng Trusan and Long Teligan worked with the University of Nottingham Malaysia to replant native vegetation and reinforce slopes with natural materials.\u201cLocals co-manage the project with authorities. It\u2019s proof that blending wisdom works,\u201d Chin noted.The initiative has not only reduced erosion but also revived fish stocks, proving environmental and economic benefits can coexist.Sarawak\u2019s recent climate policies \u2013 including a 2023 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Ordinance and plans for a Climate Change Centre \u2013 draw cautious praise.\u201cGood foundations, but implementation is key,\u201d said Lavanya, who urges weaving climate risk assessments into every development decision, from infrastructure to agriculture.For example, the state\u2019s Low Carbon Society Blueprint aims to cut emissions through reforestation and renewable energy, but critics argue enforcement remains lax.Critical to this is integrated river basin management (IRBM), a strategy WWF is advising on for the Rajang River.\u201cInclusive planning that values indigenous insight is non-negotiable,\u201d stressed Chin. \u201cCommunities know their land best \u2013 their voices must lead adaptation efforts.\u201dYet challenges persist. Many villages lack resources to implement large-scale projects, and bureaucratic delays often stall progress.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen plans sit on shelves for years while rivers silt up,\u201d said Chin.\u201cThe Rajang\u2019s IRBM study, led by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, is a start.\u201cBut without funding and political will, it\u2019s just another report.\u201dA hurdle remains: sparse local climate data. Tools like the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) could sharpen flood predictions, but only with Sarawak-specific inputs.\u201cWithout hyperlocal modelling, we\u2019re planning blind,\u201d Lavanya warned.For instance, NAHRIM\u2019s rainfall projections rely on broader regional trends, which fail to capture microclimatic shifts in Sarawak\u2019s rugged interior.WWF advocates for urgent investment in weather stations and community-led monitoring.\u201cFarmers in Kapit already track rainfall with makeshift gauges.\u201cImagine pairing their observations with satellite data,\u201d said Chin. \u201cIt\u2019s about bridging high-tech and grassroots.\u201dFor WWF, the path forward is clear: pair dredging and dams with nature\u2019s ingenuity.\u201cThe choice isn\u2019t concrete or forests \u2013 it\u2019s both,\u201d said Chin. \u201cOtherwise, Sarawak will keep sinking.\u201dBut time is scarce.

He said the move aims to offer the public more affordable options while helping to stabilise market prices. \"We also plan to raise the supply of special grade eggs similar to those sold during Ramadan (March) at RM5 per tray. \"This time, we're unsure of the exact price, but we are confident it will not spike uncontrollably,\" he told reporters after attending Terengganu Pakatan Harapan's Aidilfitri open house here today. On April 30, KPKM announced the subsidy removal and outlined several intervention measures, to be implemented jointly with the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living (KPDN), to cushion the impact on consumers. Among the measures is the industry's commitment to introducing special grade eggs at reasonable prices. Mohamad said, aside from special grade eggs, consumers can obtain competitively priced eggs through nationwide initiatives such as Jualan Agro MADANI and Jualan Rahmah. He stressed that the decision to end both the egg subsidy and price controls\u2014as well as the reduction in subsidy rate from RM0.10 to RM0.05 per egg effective May 1\u2014was made through stakeholder consultation. \"The decision was reached via engagement. We negotiated first with egg producers and industry players. The removal was done in a soft-landing manner, not abruptly. Therefore, I believe egg prices will not surge,\" he said. Meanwhile, he encouraged the cultivation of local young coconuts, especially aromatic varieties such as pandan coconuts, to meet rising demand from China. \"This presents an opportunity, particularly for Terengganu with its vast land, to focus on a crop that can generate strong returns. China has a population of over 1.4 billion, with more than 800 million having spending power\u2026 this is a real economic opportunity,\" he said. On April 19, Agriculture Department director-general Datuk Nor Sam Alwi said the opening of the fresh coconut market to China under the Phytosanitary Requirements Protocol marked a strengthening of biosecurity measures and the establishment of a more systematic traceability framework for quality young coconut production. He said Malaysia will export young coconuts primarily for fresh beverage consumption, with priority given to aromatic varieties such as pandan coconuts, known for their unique fragrance and brix sweetness level of around 6.7. \u2014 BERNAMA",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) has urged the government to establish a National Action Plan on Labour Quarters to address the critical shortage of proper worker housing nationwide. Its president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the plan should be developed in collaboration with the Local Government and Development Ministry, the Human Resources Ministry, and local authorities. \"The key proposals include fast-tracked approvals for the development of Centralised Labour Quarters (CLQ) and Temporary Labour Quarters (TLQ), targeted incentives for developers and employers to build or retrofit proper worker housing, and public-private partnership models aligned with local and industrial development strategies,\" he said in a statement today. Soh said the critical shortage of CLQ and TLQ, especially in key industrial zones and logistics hubs, continued to affect worker welfare and placed significant compliance pressure on employers under the Workers' Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act 1990 (Act 446). FMM's call follows Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's Labour Day address, in which he stressed the need to redefine minimum housing standards for workers, declaring that \"one-room-one-toilet housing is no longer suitable.\" \"FMM welcomes the prime minister's keynote address, which captures the spirit of inclusive development and justice for the workforce. \"His bold assertion that when there are so many facilities for the rich, it should not be impossible to find land to build decent homes for workers reflects an urgent national priority that deserves broad support,\" Soh said. He praised the government's efforts to strengthen the labour ecosystem, including the reduction of the national unemployment rate to 3.1 per cent, the increase in female labour force participation to 56.2 per cent, and the launch of initiatives such as the Madani Employee Card and the MyFutureJobs mobile application. He said the MyFutureJobs platform, driven by artificial intelligence to match workers with jobs, would support Malaysia's digital labour market transformation. \"FMM expresses its readiness to support the utilisation and continuous improvement of the MyFutureJobs system through industry collaboration, ensuring it remains responsive to real-time market demand, skills matching, and sectoral workforce planning.

        "title": "Singapore, Australia polls hint at   geopolitical anxieties",
        "content": "The  elections in Singapore and Australia tomorrow  offer a  window into the broader disquiet that  besets  international relations. These  polls provide Asean with critical clues about how member states and their partners perceive the intensifying rivalry between China and the United States, the  unpredictability of the European Union's response to the war in Ukraine, and the enduring ambition of Russia to reclaim lost influence. The outcomes of these elections do not merely reflect national discontent or endorsement; they expose deep anxieties about a world  increasingly dominated by the ruthless pursuit of gaining an advantage over rivals (relative gains). As open, trade-dependent democracies, both countries are finely attuned to the ebb and flow of geopolitical rivalries. Their political choices tomorrow will reveal how far these global tensions have trickled down into public consciousness. For Asean, the implications are profound. In Singapore, the election will be a litmus test of the People's Action Party's  ability to reassure citizens amid economic volatility and strategic uncertainty. The island republic has long walked a tightrope between China and the US, benefiting  from both American security guarantees  and Chinese investments and trade. This balancing act is becoming increasingly difficult. The rise of digital nationalism, tensions over semiconductor supply chains, and ideological contestation between liberal and authoritarian governance models are polarising the region. Singapore's voters, while focused on cost of living and housing, are increasingly aware that their leaders must navigate an environment where choosing sides could come at great economic and political costs. Australia, on the other hand, continues to wrestle with strategic identity. Oscillating between its Anglo-American heritage and its Asian geography, Canberra has at times adopted a schizophrenic foreign policy posture \u2014 staunchly pro-American in defence, yet heavily dependent on Chinese markets for its exports. The  government of Anthony Albanese, while outwardly cooperative with  Washington and Beijing, has been cautious not to alienate either. However,  anxieties surrounding  Chinese involvement in  critical infrastructure investments,   cybersecurity threats and controversial  political donations  have fuelled public scepticism. If opposition parties like the Liberal-National Coalition perform well or even regain ground, it would signal growing discomfort with the government's hedging strategy. This, too, would serve as a data point for Asean to assess how viable multi-alignment strategies really are in an era of intensifying great power rivalries. What unites both electoral environments is a growing  fatigue with transactional global politics. Neither Singapore nor Australia is blind to the fact that major powers \u2014 from the US to China, from the EU to Russia \u2014 are increasingly operating based on finite competitive logics. The EU, while championing human rights and multilateralism, has paradoxically imposed carbon tariffs that disproportionately hurt Asean's export economies. Russia's war on Ukraine, meanwhile, has revived fears of energy weaponisation and great power revisionism. These global developments feed into domestic debates, influencing how electorates view foreign policy, economic security  and national sovereignty. For Asean, the lesson is unmistakable: the age of absolute gains is receding. The vision of a world where interdependence breeds peace and prosperity is being undermined by a geopolitical order dominated by suspicion, coercion and the pursuit of dominance. Asean's  credibility as a rules-based, non-aligned bloc will increasingly depend on its ability to read these electoral signals accurately and recalibrate its collective posture. Rather than waiting for the dust to settle from global contests, Asean must act proactively. This includes deepening regional economic integration, strengthening the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement  and enhancing political coordination in track one and track two diplomacy. If Singapore and Australia \u2014 both seen as bellwethers of the Indo-Pacific \u2014 are feeling the pressures of competing imperialism, then Asean must brace itself for even sharper dilemmas. But within those dilemmas lie  an opportunity to champion multilateralism not as a  relic of the post-Cold War order, but as a  framework to resist the tyranny of relative gains.  * The writer is a professor at the International Islamic University Malaysia",

He reaffirmed his commitment to prioritising the people's issues, in line with the three resolutions and seven pledges presented during the Ayer Kuning by-election campaign. \"This repair assistance is also part of the aspirations from those pledges and was already being implemented during the late assemblyman's term. \"I will continue these efforts to ensure we can provide help and comfort to the residents,\" he said. Meanwhile, Mansor said he built the now over-60-year-old home with his own hands. \"In the past, when the house leaked or was damaged, it was the government that provided helped. \"I am happy and grateful to have a caring representative. The late YB (Ishsam) had even visited this house twice,\" he said. Earlier, Yusri met residents in constituency, including at Batu 3, Kampung Batu Masjid, the town of Air Kuning, and Tapah Road, to express his appreciation for Barisan Nasional's (BN) victory. The former lecturer, 54, was warmly received by the public. The by-election results saw Yusri from BN winning with a majority of 5,006 votes, defeating Perikatan Nasional candidate Abdul Muhaimin Malek and K.S Bawani from the Parti Sosialis Malaysia.",

        "title": "Federal Court to decide on A-GC's appeal to block Najib's house arrest review tomorrow",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Federal Court will decide tomorrow whether to grant the Attorney-General's Chambers (A-GC) leave to appeal against Datuk Seri Najib Razak's bid for a judicial review of his house arrest order. The purported addendum order is said to have been consented to by the 16th Yang di-Pertuan Agong, permitting the former Pekan member of Parliament to serve the remainder of his prison sentence under house arrest, in relation to his conviction for misappropriating RM42 million from SRC International Sdn Bhd. The decision on the leave application will be made by a three-member panel of the Federal Court, chaired by the Chief Judge of Malaya, Datuk Seri Hasnah Mohammed Hashim, sitting alongside Datuk Zabariah Mohd Yusof and Datuk Hanipah Farikullah. If leave is granted, the Federal Court will hear seven legal questions, which, according to the applicant, the A-GC, involve matters of public interest that have not previously been heard or decided by the country's highest court before a ruling is made. However, if the leave application is dismissed, the judicial review proceedings concerning the addendum order will proceed to be heard at the High Court. On Jan 6, the Court of Appeal allowed the former Prime Minister's appeal to initiate judicial review proceedings in the High Court, seeking an order to compel the government or six other parties to respond to and verify the existence of the addendum order, dated January of the previous year. In the judicial review, Najib has named the Home Minister, Commissioner General of Prisons, Attorney-General, Pardons Board for the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan, and Putrajaya, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), the Director-General of the Legal Affairs Division in the Prime Minister's Department, and the Government of Malaysia as respondents. Among the reliefs sought in the judicial review is for all or any of the respondents to provide a copy of the principal decree by the 16th Yang di-Pertuan Agong concerning the reduction of his prison sentence and fine. Najib is also seeking an order that, should the decree exist, all or any of the respondents must implement it by transferring him from Kajang Prison to his residence in Kuala Lumpur immediately to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. Najib has been serving his sentence in Kajang Prison since Aug 23, 2022, after being convicted of misappropriating RM42 million belonging to SRC International Sdn Bhd. He filed a petition seeking royal pardon on Sept 2, 2022. The Pardons Board later reduced his prison sentence from 12 years to six years and his fine from RM210 million to RM50 million. On July 3 last year, the High Court dismissed Najib's application to initiate judicial review proceedings, prompting him to appeal the decision at the Court of Appeal. The High Court ruled that four affidavits supporting Najib's claims, including statements by Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and vice-president Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail, were hearsay and could not be accepted as evidence.",

Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC) and Malaysian AIDS Foundation (MAF) honorary secretary Dr Zaiton Yahaya said those aged between 20 and 29 accounted for 44 per cent of individuals detected with HIV. \"As for school students aged 13 to 19, four per cent were confirmed to have contracted HIV, with the majority infected through sexual activity. \"The highest number of cases are among school leavers and university graduates, who are largely unaware of the risks of infection. However, cases of HIV transmission through drug use are decreasing, as we have consistently carried out awareness programmes on the dangers of sharing needles. \"Due to the increasing rate of sexually transmitted HIV infections, we have stepped up awareness initiatives to ensure patients know where to seek help and support,\" she said after the Aidilfitri Open House with the community and the launch of the ProtectNow Hub organised by MAC and MAF here today. Zaiton said that due to the significant rise in cases among young people, various awareness programmes on HIV infections have been conducted in schools and universities. According to the latest statistics from the Health Ministry, a total of 135,035 HIV patients have been recorded from 1986 to 2023, with 54,365 cases resulting from sexual transmission. There have been eight new cases of HIV infection involving children under the age of 13. The latest records show that 62 per cent of HIV infections were among homosexual and bisexual individuals, while 33 per cent were among heterosexual partners. Meanwhile, MAC and MAF have launched the ProtectNow Hub, the first digital HIV prevention services platform in Malaysia. ProtectNow Hub was developed through collaboration between public health experts, community organisations, and young people. Since its introduction, the platform has received over 74,000 visits from individuals seeking easily accessible, safe, and community-oriented healthcare services. The platform provides immediate access to a variety of essential services such as PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), HIV self-testing, mental health support, and addiction recovery services. Zaiton said that with its inclusive digital approach, ProtectNow Hub aims to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health, free from stigma and misinformation. \"We are facing a major shift in HIV infections, with an increasing number of new cases among young people and target communities. \"ProtectNow represents a new, youth-centred, community-led, and digitally driven approach for the future,\" she said.",

        "content": "KOTA BARU: The Health Ministry is closely monitoring two key issues following the tariffs imposed by United States (US) President Donald Trump, particularly those affecting medical devices and pharmaceutical products. Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad said that although Trump had previously indicated an intention to exempt pharmaceuticals from these tariffs, recent developments suggest otherwise. \"Some of the announced tariffs remain unclear, and with Trump's unpredictability, we must remain vigilant. It is crucial for me, as the health minister, to stay attentive to these two matters,\" he told a press conference after opening the state-level 2025 Madani Afiat Programme in Tunjong here today. He was responding to questions about the potential impact of the US tariffs on the nation's healthcare supply chain. Dzulkefly said the ministry was also making early preparations to find alternative markets and sources to ensure the continuity of the country's health supply is not affected. On April 2, Trump announced a series of reciprocal tariffs imposed on many countries, including 24 per cent on imports of goods from Malaysia, but this has been postponed for 90 days. Meanwhile, regarding the ban on the sale of electronic cigarette (vape) products by the Terengganu government effective Aug 1, he said the ministry was determined to implement comprehensive regulation on vape products with the gazette of the Smoking Products Control for Public Health Act 2024. He said the act, which functions as a stand-alone legislation, would serve as a strong foundation for regulating all aspects related to smoking products, including their registration, sales, advertising, and nicotine content. \"Our approach is to enforce strict regulation. Sales to minors will be completely prohibited, and stringent controls will be in place to ensure there is no room for any form of leniency,\" he said. He said the state government holds an important responsibility through its authority to deny business licences to entrepreneurs selling smoking products. He viewed the collaboration by the state government as a positive step towards safeguarding public health. The Terengganu government announced it will enforce a ban on the sale of vape products at all business premises across the state starting Aug 1. Terengganu Local Government, Housing and Health Committee Chairman Datuk Wan Sukairi Wan Abdullah was reported as saying that the enforcement is a proactive move by the state government to curb the sale and use of vape products, which pose health risks, particularly to the younger generation. \u2013 Bernama",

        "content": "LONDON: The Asean Power Grid A(APG) is a pillar that can strengthen cooperation among the bloc's member states, said Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof. Fadillah, who is also the energy transition and water transformation minister, said that given the importance of this cooperation, Malaysia, as the Asean Chair this year, will focus on realising the APG, thereby enhancing energy security, accessibility, and affordability in the region. Citing the gas explosion in Putra Heights, Subang Jaya, on April 1, he said the incident led to the shutdown of the gas pipeline involved, affecting the public as well as industries. However, he said that thanks to strong ties with Thailand, the neighbouring country supplied gas to Malaysia, thus helping to mitigate the impact on about 200 industries and consumers. \"The incident may be perceived as being localised, but the effects extended to the north because gas from the south couldn't reach there following the shutdown to prevent (fire) from spreading further. \"We are grateful to Thailand for providing the assistance,\" he said during a dinner and meet-and-greet event with the Malaysian diaspora in the United Kingdom (UK) at the Malaysian High Commission in London on Friday. A total of 80 guests, including students and staff from government-linked companies and the Malaysian High Commission in London, were present. Also present were Malaysian High Commissioner to the UK and Northern Ireland Datuk Zakri Jaafar, Tenaga Nasional Bhd chief new energy officer Mohd Zarihi Mohd Hashim, Sarawak Energy Bhd group chief executive officer Datuk Sharbini Suhaili, and a delegation from the ministry. Fadillah said Thailand's assistance is proof that the APG is crucial for Asean member countries, especially during unforeseen events. \"For example, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Laos experience strong winds and can harness wind energy. But when they face wind shortages for generating electricity, other member countries can step in to help. \"This shows that if we can cooperate regionally, it will ensure a sufficient and affordable energy supply \u2014 this is what we envision with the APG,\" he said. Fadillah arrived in the UK from T\u00fcrkiye on Wednesday to lead the Malaysian delegation to the two-day Summit on the Future of Energy Security 2025 held at Lancaster House here ending yesterday. \u2013 Bernama",

The matter was revealed in a joint statement by the Home Affairs Ministry (MHA) and the Elections Department (ELD) yesterday, Berita Harian reported. They identified Pas treasurer-general Iskandar Abdul Samad and Selangor Pas Youth Chief Mohamed Sukri Omar as the two individuals involved in the interference. The MHA and ELD issued directives under Section 61N of the Parliamentary Elections Act (PEA). Quoting a Berita Harian Singapore report, it was reported that both individuals had published Facebook posts commenting on Singapore's political landscape. In addition, Pas-owned publication Harakah Daily published two articles on April 22 and 23 quoting Iskandar's remarks about the Malay community in Singapore and the GE2025. The two articles were titled, \"Singapore GE: Malay Candidates Increasingly Prominent\" and \"Don't Repeat the Scenario of Malays Being 'Removed' from the City. \"The joint statement from MHA and ELD on April 25 said it is an offence for foreigners to influence Singapore's general elections. \"Foreigners must not direct, finance, or in any way influence Singapore's elections. \"It is an offence under the PEA for foreigners to engage in election-related activities or publish online election advertising (OEA). \"Singapore's politics must be determined solely by Singaporeans,\" the statement said. Iskandar had expressed support for several candidates contesting in GE2025 through his Facebook page. Among them were Workers' Party (WP) candidate Faisal Manap and Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Damanhuri Abas. Writing on his Facebook account, Iskandar said: \"It would be a shame if Faisal lost after all the good work he has done since 2011. \"He has raised many issues, especially the hijab issue, and bravely told parliament that in Islam, religion cannot be separated from politics. \"I hope he will succeed again despite the odds,\" he wrote. He also posted a screenshot of Damanhuri's speech on Nomination Day and said: \"His strong words should serve as a lesson. '60 years in power, and goodwill is trampled on'.\" Harakah Daily also published articles quoting Iskandar.In the article \"Singapore GE: Malay Candidates Increasingly Prominent,\" he named three Malay WP candidates Siti Alia Abdul Rahim Mattar, Abdul Muhaimin Abdul Malik, and Sufyan Mikhail Putra who caught his attention, in addition to Faisal and Damanhuri. \"Many may assume that Malays in Singapore don't dare to challenge the government, but the current situation suggests otherwise. \"These candidates are no ordinary individuals \u2013 they are well-educated and professionally accomplished,\" he said. Earlier, he had also raised concerns over the use of consultancy services from Singapore's Housing and Development Board (HDB) for urban renewal efforts. He feared that Singapore's housing ownership model could be viewed as a foreign migration agenda, potentially displacing urban poor Malays when property is sold at market prices, beyond their financial reach. \"When we look at urban renewal developments in Singapore, the impact on Malays is extremely negative. \"Before independence, there were parliamentary seats in Singapore where Malays were the majority,\" he said in the article \"Don't Repeat the Scenario of Malays Being 'Removed' from the City\". Meanwhile, Selangor Pas Youth Chief Mohamed Sukri Omar shared a post by Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff, who renounced his Singaporean citizenship for Australian citizenship in 2020, on the issue of the hijab in Singapore, titled \"Hijab in Singapore: Why Can't Malay MPs Be Our Hope?\" In the post, Sukri linked Malaysia's Democratic Action Party (DAP) to Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP).",

As Malaysia's transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs gains traction, MSB Global managing director Datuk Ow Kee Foo said it aims to diversify its revenue streams and benefit from the anticipated growth in EV ownership here. Ow said the company plans to allocate RM840,000 or 3.14 per cent of its initial public offering (IPO) proceeds for its new in house branded EV charger. \"Our group intends to market, trade and distribute our in-house branded EV charger. We target to launch our in-house branded EV charger by the second quarter of 2025. \"Introducing our in-house branded charger will allow us to meet the rising demand for EV infrastructure and participate in the growth of the EV market in Malaysia,\" he told Business Times. Recently, MSB Global dropped 15 per cent on its ACE Market debut, closing at 17 sen, down from its IPO price of 20 sen per share. It is the sixth ACE Market listing since March to close below its IPO price. Investor demand during its IPO, which raised RM41.4 million, was also relatively weak with applications from retail investors totalling about six times the available shares for subscription. The company is allocating 22.58 per cent of the total proceeds from the public issue to buy new machinery and equipment, about 18.7 per cent for the construction of a new factory and warehouse, and another 3.14 per cent for its new in-house EV charger. MSB Global will also set aside 20.67 per cent for the repayment of bank borrowings, while the balance is for general working capital and to defray the listing expenses. Ow said the company believes Malaysia's automotive market is thriving, with a growing vehicle population driving strong demand for aftersales services, parts and components. As technological advancements and EV adoption gain momentum, he said the automotive aftermarket sector is expected to continue growing, although a shift to EVs may impact demand for certain traditional parts. \"The market for automotive lubricants and fluids is also on the rise, driven by the high volume of passenger vehicles and frequent oil changes. \"Overall, the automotive aftersales market in Malaysia presents a dynamic growth opportunity with a mix of traditional and evolving demands,\" he added.",

It is not just about providing a roof over people\u2019s heads, it is about creating spaces that enrich their lives. It must be designed with humanity at its core, focusing on the needs and well-being of the people who will call it home.\u201cThe new PRR concept emphasises five key principles:accessibility, sustainability, liveability, connectivity and mobility with public facilities.\u201cIt incorporates sustainable features, such as Green Building Index (GBI), solar panels and rainwater collection system to ensure that the urban poor are not left behind during the transition into a green economy.\u201cEqually important are the humane elements - community centres, childcare facilities and green public spaces that foster connection and support.\u201cIn line with the government\u2019s aspirations, we must ensure that these homes do not just meet basic needs but enhance the quality of life for every individual and family.\u201cWe must focus on finding a balance between the rapid growth of the property market and the need for affordable housing. We must avoid the tale of two cities - where one part of the city remains rich, and the other part remains poor,\u201d said Nga.He pointed out that according to the National Property Information Centre\u2019s (NAPIC) Property Market Report, affordable houses priced at RM300,000 and below made up 52.5% of total residential transactions last year.\u201cThis indicates a strong demand from Malaysians for affordable homes.

Do not vandalise the walls. Ensure that the trash is disposed of properly. Embrace a civic mindset. This is the key to maintaining the quality and elevating the status of our affordable housing in the country,\u201d said Nga.The minister said that the 4P model - people, public and private partnerships will enable more Malaysians to own homes.\u201cDevelopers need to embrace the \u2018profit with purpose\u2019 mindset, banks to provide financial support, and communities to play their civil part in maintaining public spaces,\u201d said Nga.Under the 12th Malaysia Plan, the Housing and Local Government Ministry will build 500,000 affordable housing units such as PR1MA, Rumah Kediaman SPNB and Rumah Mesra Rakyat.As of December last year, 93.9% of the target with 466,421 units was approved.\u201cLast year, Malaysia witnessed a steady growth in the property market, where we recorded RM232.2bil total property transactions in value, involving 420,545 units,\u201d said Nga.Malaysia currently has a shortfall of about 400,000 housing units, one of the lowest in the region.\u00a0",

These efforts create ripple effects that drive meaningful and transformative change in communities,\u201d added Novan.   ",

On a global scale, the used cooking oil market was valued at US$7.09bil in 2023 and is projected to nearly double to US$13.96bil by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 8%, as reported by Fortune Business Insights.Recognising these challenges, Greencents, a group of final-year Master\u2019s students from UKM-Graduate School of Business (UKM-GSB) launched the O2C Revolution \u2013 a project that raises awareness about used cooking oil recycling and provides financial benefits to communities in need.\"This two-day event at the Sri Sabah 3A public housing and Block 3 Pudu Ulu, Cheras people housing project (PPR) is more than just a recycling initiative,\u201d said Greencents project lead Kavita Kaur. \u201cIt\u2019s about financial empowerment, environmental conservation and driving change through community engagement.\u201dResidents were encouraged to collect and exchange their used cooking oil for cash, turning everyday waste into an additional income source. Through this programme, used cooking oil recycling helps reduce carbon emissions, prevent water pollution and support sustainable energy solutions.The community\u2019s response has been overwhelmingly positive. In just two days, the O2C Revolution successfully collected one tonne of used cooking oil from approximately 120 participants, proving that collective action can drive meaningful change. This milestone underscores the urgent need for a structured used cooking oil recycling programme while highlighting the community's willingness to embrace sustainable practices when provided with the right incentives.The O2C Revolution was made possible through the collaboration of the Association of Used Cooking Oil Development Malaysia (AUCO), and the residence associations at Sri Sabah 3A and the Pudu Ulu Blok 3.It was supported by WCT Holdings Bhd, AUCO and Capital Oil and Fats Sdn Bhd. This initiative underscores the power of collective action in turning waste into economic opportunity while championing sustainability.The O2C Revolution embodies a commitment towards sustainability and financial resilience, empowering underserved communities through innovative waste management.

Together, we can turn waste into wealth and create a cleaner, more sustainable future.A programme participant contributed 53kg of recycled cooking oil, collected over the past year, demonstrating the power of consistent effort in sustainability.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Dr Norhayati Mohd Noor has been receiving no less than three stress-related cases a month involving children residing in low-cost high-rise schemes in the Klang Valley, developed under the People\u2019s Housing Programme (PPR), since she started conducting family counselling and psychoeducational programmes 12 years ago.Norhayati, who was also a senior lecturer at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia\u2019s Genius@Pintar Negara Foundation Programme, said the parents who sought her services told her they were worried about their children as they did not want to go to school and were rebellious and also seemed unhappy and withdrawn.Her meetings with the children concerned found that most of them were bogged down by pressure due to their unconducive living environment, cramped living quarters and lack of facilities for sports and recreational activities.\"Most of their parents were not aware their children were feeling stressed because their (parents\u2019) lives were similar too when they were young... for instance, living with large families.\"I concluded, however, they (parents) lacked empathy because the low-cost housing environment they lived in was different then... for example, even though their houses were small, recreational areas were available unlike now where space is limited and there\u2019s no place for children to play,\" she told Bernama.Sharing the case of a 10-year-old boy who lived in a PPR scheme, Norhayati said he was stressed out as his parents and neighbours would scold him each time he and his friends wanted to play a game like football.Since there was no playground or field near the flats they lived in, they had no choice but to play inside their homes or the corridor which angered their neighbours.\"Some PPR schemes are provided with space for recreation but they are usually filled with the adult residents, leaving the children feeling stressed and unhappy.From a psychological point of view, children are naturally inclined to play and have fun which shapes their emotional and social well-being. In fact, studies have shown that children who play less tend to be more vulnerable to mental stress,\" she added.Not comfortableIncidentally, a recent study carried out by the Ministry of Health\u2019s Institute for Health Behavioural Research and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (Unicef) revealed that 13.4% of adolescents and children living in PPR schemes in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur had thoughts of suicide and self-harm while over 12.3% experienced mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.The study involved 1,578 children aged between 10 and 17 residing in 37 PPR schemes.Meanwhile, commenting on why PPR children tend to lose interest in school, Norhayati said due to the limited space in their homes they usually don\u2019t have their own table and chair to do their homework or study.Not only that, it could get rather noisy too due to the narrow corridors and thin walls separating the residential units, making it difficult for the children to focus on their schoolwork.\"However, I\u2019ve seen PPR children trying to work hard to achieve good results so that they can get a place in a fully-residential school and get out of their congested homes,\" she said.On the PPR adolescents\u2019 suicidal tendencies, the experienced counsellor said there were various contributing factors among them being their economic state and the financial problems faced by their parents.\"They often feel unhappy and inferior when they compare themselves to their friends whose families are well-off,\" she said.According to Norhayati, there was a marked difference between living in a kampung and PPR scheme. Kampung communities were homogeneous, meaning they share similar social status, whereas PPR residents were heterogeneous as they hailed from different income groups.Consider well-being of PPR childrenDescribing the well-being of PPR residents as an issue that needs to be addressed effectively, she said for children and adolescents, healthy psychological development was crucial in order to produce emotionally, physically and mentally stable human capital.\"It\u2019s not just the mental health issues of the teenagers and children that is worrying us... but its impact on the well-being of the people around them also needs to be considered.\"This is because mental problems don\u2019t just involve individuals and their families. We also have to look at the overall impact as it can destroy a nation,\" she said, adding that people who were happy in their childhood and adolescent years would definitely be psychologically healthy as well.In order to create more liveable PPR schemes, Norhayati saw a need for various government agencies to collaborate to provide the necessary activities, infrastructure and family psychoeducational programmes (to look into financial, education and health aspects) for the residents.She also saw a need for each PPR community to create a team to strengthen ties between the families and residents as well as looked into their well-being.\"They must cooperate to look after their well-being, not just the physical aspect but also psychological.\"They can, for instance, introduce a rule to make it compulsory for the PPR children to return home by 8pm and teenagers by 9pm.\"In Istanbul, Turkiye, there is a PPR-like housing scheme where children are only allowed to be outdoors until 5pm and if they are not home by then, their parents will be penalised,\" she said.She added that the authorities could also fine-tune programmes that were of interest to children living in PPR flats and provide the necessary facilities for them as most of them were from low-income families.Liveable housingMeanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia Department of Architecture senior lecturer Associate Prof Dr Mohd Zairul Mohd Noor opined that the National Housing Policy must be reviewed to provide for more conducive, comfortable and better quality low-cost housing.This was necessary to ensure public housing schemes were built with the demography and sociocultural needs of the local community in mind and not in accordance with the wishes of developers that only prioritise profits.\"State governments and GLCs (government-linked companies) such as SPNB (Syarikat Perumahan Negara Bhd) and Uda Holdings Bhd are responsible for building low-cost houses.\"There will be problems if a state government is dependent on private developers to build such houses as the latter will only think of making a profit, so there will be shortcomings in terms of the facilities and design of the buildings and landscaping,\" he said, adding that a housing scheme was only deemed complete if it incorporated humanitarian elements and greenery to enable its residents to live in a harmonious and positive environment.Mohd Zairul also said the locations of PPR schemes must be reviewed to ensure they were not built in remote areas bereft of development and facilities.\"PPR residents are mostly from the B40 group and they cannot be marginalised. Our future low-cost housing planning policies need to take note of the residents\u2019 social and economic status as they have the same right as Malaysians from other income groups to improve their quality of life and income.Transit home for youthsTo resolve the overcrowding issue faced by the sandwich generation living in the compact PPR flats - mostly occupied by middle-aged adults who stay with their ageing parents and their own children - Mohd Zairul said the government could consider providing more transit homes for youths to stay before they became financially independent.He said Malaysia currently lacked housing for youths, especially those without a fixed income, so they ended up staying with their parents and younger siblings.\"I once did a study at a flat in Larkin, Johor, where a family with six children stayed. All the children were working but still lived with their parents because they couldn\u2019t afford to rent a house.\"You can imagine how congested their unit was,\" he added.Dr Mohd Hafizal Ishak, a researcher at the Centre of Excellence For Facility Management at the Faculty of Technological and Business Management, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, said low-cost housing schemes had transformed significantly since the 1990s, adding that the schemes now had better infrastructure and facilities compared to those built long ago.\"We can see infrastructure and facilities like garbage collection centres, drainage and sewage systems, children\u2019s playgrounds and security systems including CCTVs at the newer PPR schemes.\"The only thing lacking is the culture of cleanliness and this is where the JMB (joint management body committee), residents associations and local councils can play a more proactive role in educating the residents on the importance of maintaining the cleanliness of their premises,\u201d he said. - Bernama",

        "content": "Siti Fatihah Zaini, 40, has high hopes for her group, the PPR Hicom's Women\u2019s Association (Perwacom), as the country celebrates its 67th National Day tomorrow.\"We hope to bring the spirit of Merdeka to our residents, children and our nation,\" says Siti Fatihah who is the deputy chairperson.\u201cThis is crucial as we live together in a multicultural society,\" says the mother of six children, between 18 years and three months old.Perwacom, a grassroots organisation started by the women residents of the People's Housing Programme (PPR) in Kampung Baru Hicom in 2019, was originally formed to address issues faced by residents. A year later, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it handled issues such as such food access, healthcare and online learning, as well as helped residents reduce stress and difficulties brought on by the health emergency.Today, it continues to grow from strength to strength, five years after it was officially registered, embodying the spirit of this year\u2019s Merdeka theme, Malaysia Madani: Jiwa Merdeka as the movement strives to improve its residents' livelihoods and empower women and children.Perwacom committee members with some of the crocheted, knitted and amigurumi items made by the women at PPR Hicom.Now, Perwacom has 15 to 20 members and four committee members: Chairperson Norizan Mohd Nor, 52, Siti Fatihah, secretary Noor Hayati Ismail, 47, and treasurer Zaidatulnisa Salleh, 40.Norizan says one of the reasons the women of PPR Hicom started the association was to help residents who had lost their income during the pandemic.When companies shut down or halted work during the MCO, many residents who worked at the nearby factories lost their only source of income and couldn't earn a living, she shares.\u201cWe wanted to not just look after our own welfare, but also that of our community,\u201d says the single mother who has six children from the ages of 25 to 11, who earns a living by sending children in the area to, and fetching them from school.Realising that it would be difficult to get anything done on their own, the women decided to band together under the association to apply for aid from the government and various NGOs.Before this, Norizan says, nobody knew about PPR Hicom, and aid usually went elsewhere but rarely to them.Standing on the banks of the Klang River, in front of their apartment building, Noor Hayati points towards an area across the river.\"That's Taman Sri Muda where major floods happened in December 2021. From 7pm on the first day, we already heard cries for help, and even until 4am on the second day, we could still hear their pleas. But sadly, we couldn't reach them because there was no access. We too, were trapped in our homes because of the floodwater, and the only exit to get to the main road was inaccessible due to the flood,\" she recounts.\"We couldn't go out because the lower floors of the PPR, as well as all the vehicles, were submerged. Our area was like an island, surrounded by water, she adds.\"We've gone through tragedies and hardships \u2013 the pandemic, MCO and the Shah Alam flash floods, but through them all, we've learnt, triumphed and came out stronger,\" Noor Hayati adds, as she takes StarLifestyle on a tour of the premises.  Through World Vision's One Goal Malaysia initiative, youth from PPR Hicom learn sportsmanship by playing badminton and participating in tournaments with other communities.After the Covid-19 pandemic, Perwacom continues its efforts.\"Our mission and focus now is to empower women and children,\" shares Noor Hayati. \"Our community has faced many setbacks and gone through the pandemic and flash floods, but we're ready to rise again.\"\"During the pandemic, many of us were affected \u2013 people lost their jobs, had to take on different types of work, lost loved ones and family. Then, when we were hit by the floods, we lost our property \u2013 cars, motorbikes, and other vehicles; homes, furniture and appliances.To help these families, Perwacom offers upskilling opportunities for the women and collaborates with programmes such as Teach for Malaysia and Impian Kencana for the children.The children's programmes, Noor Hayati says, are designed to motivate the young ones to not give up despite the hardships they have faced or are facing, and equip them with new skills.\"Our focus isn't just on formal education, but also informal learning. We look at the physical and mental well-being of our children too.\"We've implemented external programmes such as World Vision's One Goal Malaysia, a movement to empower urban poor children in Malaysia to eat right, play right and live right by leveraging on their love of sports,\" she says.This is Perwacom's second year in this programme and its focus is badminton.PPR Hicom is one of the few PPRs that has a badminton court in its compound and Perwacom organises tournaments in the PPR community for young people to learn about sportsmanship.\"Last year, we had a tournament with PPR Kota Damansara and PPR Lembah Subang. Who knows, in future, perhaps a Malaysian badminton champion may come from the PPR community,\" she adds.  Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim visited PPR Hicom in 2023. Photo: Facebook/Anwar IbrahimIn the association hall, many certificates are displayed, a testament to the PPR Hicom community's capabilities.There are also samples of products the women have made including beadings on shoes, embellishments on clothes, knitted pieces, crocheted items like amigurumi toys and decorations.But the women aren't just skilled workers. They hope to transfer the skills they've learnt to their community at PPR Hicom, as well as other PPR communities such as Perumahan Awam (PA) Sri Selangor and Sri Sarawak in Kuala Lumpur.The group also applied for the Kita Untuk Kita (K2K) grant to fund its women empowerment project in sewing, cooking and baking. The funds were used to purchase equipment and appliances for their small enterprises so these women could earn an income.\u201cFor example, a sewing machine costs RM7,000 and we can't afford it, but we've applied through the grant to purchase it and it's placed here at the community centre for use,\u201d says Noor Hayati, adding that last year, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim visited PPR Hicom and announced additional funding of RM35mil for PPRs in KL and Selangor, and the grants \u2013 some of which are pending approval \u2013 are from this allocation.The K2K programme was launched by Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Amirudin Shari in 2021. The government worked together with Think City to help improve the lives of people living in the PPR and the pilot project was at PPR Hicom.Thanks to K2K, Perwacom has implemented several projects. Among them is Program Remaja Cemerlang, a course for youth from the ages of 13 to 17 to motivate them to pursue their goals and fulfil their purpose in life.Zaidatulnisa believes that empowering the next generation is important.\u201cPeople often see children from PPR communities as not smart, always loafing around and delinquents, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Our children have the potential to be just as successful as children from affluent communities. We\u2019ve had children from the PPR attend youth conferences and participate in debates. Whenever there are activities, they\u2019re always at the forefront,\u201d says the mother of three children aged between 16 and one.  Children learning from Adab Youth Garage youth workers at the 'Homework Club' at PPR Hicom.Next to the association hall is the Homework Club, an initiative led by Adab Youth Garage\u2019s Youth Leaders Club (YLC) Hicom and comprises youth from the ages of 13 to 17.Here, children are taught effective learning techniques. They are given tips on how to do homework, study, prepare for their exams and do well in them. This is different from school, which focuses on the formal syllabus.\u201cThis was done at the request of the students themselves; it wasn\u2019t imposed on them by the adults. As parents, it's encouraging to see our children wanting to learn and taking the initiative to apply for the grant and having their classes here,\u201d she says.\u201cFor now, they have classes on learning techniques for three subjects: Bahasa Malaysia, History and Mathematics, from Form One to Five. They focus on one subject per month, with lower secondary on Saturdays, and upper secondary on Sundays,\" Zaidatulnisa says.\"They also have what we call Happy Hour which is experiential learning where the youth explore the world around them, such as going on a trip like to the museum,\" she adds.The 'Homework Club' at PPR Hicom is a facility for the residents' children to learn how to study better and score in their exams, do their homework, and more.Noor Hayati adds that last year was a proud moment for them when one of the residents' child \u2013 Maizatulakma Lisa Aqilah Abdullah \u2013 was selected to participate in Teach for Malaysia's Kids Education Revolution Programme in Mumbai, India.\"There were four youths from Malaysia including from PPR Hicom and they had to take part in a parliamentary style debate with other participants who were college students, teachers and lecturers,\" she says.Then there is the Cooking Project where five participants from PPR Hicom were sent to learn from Akademi Memasak Chef Liza, of reality TV show MasterChef Malaysia.\"After they've taken a course in confectionary and catering, they are certified and can then teach others in the community what they have learnt,\" says Noor Hayati.Training is also provided through the Human Resource Development Council (HRDC). One of its programmes is Program Latihan Madani which empowers Malaysia's underserved communities through learning and development.It runs programmes on food safety and quality, and the certification is recognised by the Health Ministry, she says.Women residents can also take digital marketing courses that teach them how to market the products they make, be it food or handicrafts.Residents of PPR Hicom showcase their talents in the Projek Keceriaan which aims to beautify and invigorate their surroundings.Perwacom's latest project is Projek Keceriaan which is a long-term effort to beautify and enhance the PPR Hicom flats. The purpose is to strengthen community ties, build cooperation and communication among the residents since they have to work together on the project.It's a floor-by-floor project for all three blocks.Through Projek Keceriaan, residents at PPR Hicom build camaraderie and learn to work together to beautify their surroundings.\"Often, even though people live in the same building, they don't know each other. They don't even talk to their neighbours on the same floor. This project encourages them to come out and get to know their neighbours,\" says Noor Hayati.\"They have to clean the corridors together, repaint the walls, meet and discuss how to beautify and decorate the area, so they will get to know each other,\" she adds.\u201cWe want to be a role model and a good example to be emulated by other PPRs, and to educate Malaysian society about the PPR community,\u201d says Siti Fatihah.\u201cPeople often have negative perceptions that those who live in PPR flats are lazy, dirty, uneducated and poor, and that children living in PPR flats have bleak future,\" says Siti Fatihah.\"We want to remove this stigma, and change the mindset of people out there; PPR residents can be successful like any other community. We hope to be seen as a community with a vision,\u201d she concludes.    ",

He said strict measures must be enforced to prevent financial mismanagement, which could delay crucial housing projects, particularly those aimed at lower-income groups. \"The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) must be firm in issuing warnings to prevent the misappropriation of funds. \"For instance, if a project is allocated RM77 million, RM10 million was already unaccounted for. \"Hence, I want to remind Perbadanan PR1MA Malaysia (PR1MA), the ministry, and municipal councils that if we aspire to elevate Malaysia as a great nation, we must remain united and uphold integrity,\" he said in his speech at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Residensi Rakyat Programme (PRR) in Bestari Jaya today. Also present was Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming. Anwar also stressed the importance of learning from global events, citing political and economic instability in various countries as a cautionary example. He cited the tensions between China and the West, the war in Ukraine, and the destruction in Gaza as critical events Malaysia should observe. \"We must not follow that path. We need peace, and we must remain strong. \"Those who can do business should pursue opportunities, plantation workers must maintain discipline, and government officers must carry out their duties responsibly. \"I believe we can achieve this,\" he said. The prime minister expressed hope that the PRR Bestari Jaya project would serve as a model for all estate housing, enabling the ministry to develop better housing solutions for estate workers. He highlighted the project's success in leveraging public-private partnerships (PPP), involving the federal government, the Selangor government, PR1MA, and Berjaya Corporation Bhd. \"This project has a long history. It was previously owned by a French company, but now it has been successfully taken over. \"For decades, disputes persisted, but I want to thank the minister, Nga, who, as soon as he took office, took immediate action to resolve the issue. \"The housing development plan here is significantly improved, providing well-structured homes for comfortable living. \"In the past, housing issues persisted in places like Bandar Tun Razak and Sri Perlis for 50 years. \"What was suitable back then no longer meets today's needs. \"That is why projects like this must continue,\" he said. Anwar also urged all relevant agencies to expedite approvals to ensure construction progresses without unnecessary delays. \"This means the project can be implemented immediately, and if possible, completed before 2027. \"This is not a massive project, so if we push forward a little, we can complete it even sooner,\" he said. The government last year announced RM75 million in assistance for the construction of People's Housing Projects (PPR) to address housing issues affecting 245 estate workers in Bestari Jaya. Nga previously said that the construction of 245 PRR units would be led by PR1MA, with Berjaya as a strategic partner. This development follows the eviction of estate workers in Bestari Jaya from five estates in the area, leaving them without homes since 2016. The issue had been ongoing for 26 years (since 1998) when the workers first moved to the estates. The affected estates were Ladang Mary, Ladang Nigel Gardner, Ladang Sungai Tinggi, Ladang Minyak, and Ladang Bukit Tagar.",

        "content": "PUCHONG: Comprehensive and proactive cooperation and involvement between the local community and the agencies involved are crucial to ensuring that every government programme has a positive impact on the people. Finance Minister II Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said the local community's acceptance and commitment from the agencies involved could ensure that each programme implemented achieves the set objectives. He said that when (programmes) are done in the right way and are continued properly (by the local community), we will have the success (that we aim for). \"We see friends (entrepreneurs) who have indeed succeeded, as they started with nothing and now have their own shops. \"That is the way CIMB and the Madani government have done it. \"We are not just providing support, as we want to build an ecosystem that will grow, where we invest in building communities,\" he told reporters after officiating the \"Satu Pemimpin Satu Kampung Santuni Madani Programme\" launch ceremony organised by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd here today. Through the Santuni Madani programme, CIMB has allocated RM3.6 million over two years to drive long-term and positive impact for approximately 9,000 residents in four people's housing projects (PPR) by strengthening capacity building, offering skills development opportunities, providing access to quality education and fostering sustainable living. Santuni Madani is a government initiative involving leaders from various federal ministries, agencies, departments, statutory bodies, government-linked investment companies and government-linked companies to bridge the socio-economic gap among underserved groups. In his officiating speech, Amir Hamzah said the government is committed to ensuring that no one is left behind in efforts towards a more inclusive and sustainable Malaysia. \"The programme spearheaded by CIMB demonstrates the important role of the private sector in empowering vulnerable groups and driving meaningful change through the Santuni Madani initiative. \"Its efforts to highlight the needs of all age groups by providing specific comprehensive support are appreciated, and this is in line with the government's goal of building a competitive and progressive society by reducing poverty, unemployment and school dropout,\" he said. CIMB group chief executive officer Novan Amirudin said that as a purpose-driven organisation, CIMB is committed to improving the quality of life of the community and expanding its social finance efforts to reach more communities, helping them build resilience, focusing on economic issues including underemployment, access to education and financial literacy. \"Through the programme, we aim to promote self-sufficiency, create lasting positive impact, and ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities for individuals and families to elevate their economic standing,\" he said in a statement in conjunction with the launch. Novan said that the group's initiatives are designed to provide the right tools, resources and skills needed to build sustainable livelihoods. \"By focusing on economic empowerment and financial inclusion, we enable individuals to secure a brighter and more sustainable future. \"These efforts create ripple effects that drive meaningful and transformative change in communities,\" he added. \u2014  BERNAMA",

        "title": "A desperate mum's cry set this man and his friends on a mission to transform lives",
        "content": "AS Kuhanesapathy Thavaras Pathy (better known as Kuhan Pathy) sat on a desolate stretch of road amidst the stark wilderness of Mount Kailash, Tibet in 2014, the vastness of the landscape weighed heavily on him. Surrounded by the bleak, barren expanse, he was struck by his own insignificance \u2014 just a drop in the ocean of existence. In this remote outpost, he sought clarity and purpose, grappling with questions about his role in the world: \"In such a vast world, am I content to remain just a drop? What's my true contribution?\" That journey to the Himalayas sparked something deep inside Kuhan and set him on a path of helping others. \"It was one of the moments that transformed me,\" he says, smiling gently.   There was no turning back for the engineer who dared to dream beyond the ordinary. Driven by a passion for change, he co-founded Pepper Labs, an organisation committed to transforming lives through long-term economic empowerment and inclusive growth. Since 2015, their Skills and Development Training Programme (STDP) has been a game-changer, equipping over 500 individuals from underserved communities with the skills needed to reshape their futures. Pepper Labs extends its mission through its innovative cloud kitchen, a space that offers a fresh start for those facing economic challenges. By creating jobs and addressing food security, they've positively impacted over 1,000 lives, fostering resilience and paving the way for personal growth. With five kitchens already established, they're set to expand further, with plans to launch at least 20 digital kitchens in other communities. One of their most inspiring ventures is Masala Wheels, Malaysia's first food truck business dedicated to empowering marginalised communities. More than just serving food, it's about changing lives. Masala Wheels provides hands-on training in the F&B industry, teaching individuals how to manage and operate food trucks while offering professional catering services. \"Pepper Labs isn't just changing lives\u2026 it's rewriting what it means to give back, one meal, one skill and one future at a time,\" he says, smiling. EARLY MEMORIES   Giving back holds deep meaning for Kuhan, a Kepong native who grew up with a modest upbringing. \"My father, a Bahasa Malaysia teacher for over 40 years, has always gone the extra mile, especially for students from poor backgrounds,\" he shares. \"Even in his 70s, his passion for teaching hasn't waned.\" Kuhan's mother, a retired nurse, dedicated herself to raising him and his two siblings. From a young age, he understood that education was the key to breaking the cycle of poverty. \"There were times we struggled to put food on the table, but my parents always emphasised that education could lift us out of our circumstances,\" he shares, adding: \"I remember those tough days vividly and know what it feels like to have nothing.\" Kuhan, who scored straight A1s in his SPM, wasn't only an academic high-flyer, but also the head prefect of SMK Taman Bukit Maluri in Kuala Lumpur. Initially, he dreamt of becoming a doctor, but life had other plans. When offered a prestigious Petronas scholarship to study chemical engineering, he made a choice to let go of his dream. \"I decided to take it up instead of pursuing medicine,\" he explains, adding: \"I didn't want to drain my parents' savings. At least with the scholarship, I could go to university and make them proud!\" With a scholarship in hand, he enrolled at Universiti Teknologi Petronas to pursue a degree in chemical engineering. He went on to graduate with top honours, earning the prestigious Chancellor's Award from the university.   After securing a job, the young man encountered marginalised communities that opened his eyes to the harsh realities of poverty. \"For the first time, I saw communities far worse off than anything I'd experienced,\" he recalls. Continuing, he admits: \"That was also a turning point for me. I was so eager to help these Sri Lankan refugee children, but the only available subject was C++ programming \u2014 a topic I knew nothing about!\" Undeterred, he dedicated countless nights to teaching himself programming. With his newfound skills, he approached the temple in Brickfields, which was hosting refugees and providing education to underserved children, and offered to share his knowledge. Over the following years, the newly minted engineer volunteered as a programming teacher for these refugee children. MASALA WHEELS   While Kuhan and a few of his friends managed to escape the cycle of poverty through education and sheer determination, many in their community weren't as fortunate. They remained ensnared by hardship, trapped in a cycle that seemed impossible to break. \"It wasn't their fault,\" Kuhan says softly. \"Being poor is hard enough, but when all you have are odd jobs to scrape by, with no prospects or future, it's no surprise that so many at-risk youths from my community \u2014 and others like them \u2014 end up in petty crime or stuck in the same vicious cycle of poverty.\" The grim reality hit close to home when one of Kuhan's closest friends became entangled in a brutal gang fight. His wrist was slashed, leaving his parents desperately ferrying him from one hospital to another, pleading for someone to treat and stitch him up. Amid the chaos, a moment stuck with Kuhan forever. His friend's mother, overwhelmed and on the verge of tears, turned to him and said: \"Look at us, going from place to place. And look at you\u2026 you've managed to break out of this cycle. But what can you do for him, still trapped in it?\" \"That question haunted me,\" the father-of-two recalls. Determined to find a way to help, Kuhan and his friends \u2014 Kumaresh Pathy, Ravindran Subramaniam, Dinesh Pandian, Thanaselan Rajendran and Rubaneswaran Thevasenabathy \u2014 found themselves seated at a mamak stall under a sprawling tree in Taman Bukit Maluri, brainstorming over teh tarik. They turned to their injured friend, asking bluntly: \"What do you know? What are you good at?\" Without hesitation, the friend answered: \"I know food. I can cook.\" That was all they needed to hear. Pooling their savings, they scraped together RM15,000 \u2014 every sen they could spare. \"We bought the ugliest van you could find on Mudah.com!\" Kuhan says, laughing. Continuing, he shares: \"It looked more like a pasar malam van than anything else. But it was a start. We thought, why not a food truck? It wouldn't need as much capital and it could be the beginning of something bigger.\" That battered van became a symbol of hope \u2014 not just for their friend, but also for their entire community. \"People kept asking, 'Why Indians? Why start this venture in Sungai Buloh?'\" Kuhan recalls.   His answer was straightforward. \"This is where the at-risk youths were,\" he says bluntly. \"The highest population of at-risk youths in the area were Indians. It was that simple.\" Food became a unifying force \u2014 a way to bring meaningful change to the lives of at-risk youths. Kuhan and his friends met with parents, urging them to let their children join the initiative. \"Tell them to come to the truck after school hours and work there,\" they said. By day, they sold food, by night they gave meals to the homeless. \"We realised we could solve problems by generating income while giving these youths a sense of purpose and hope for others,\" he says. \"We believed that if we could help him turn his life around, he could become a mentor to other young people, showing them that change was possible,\" Kuhan explains.   What began as a simple favour for a friend quickly snowballed into something far greater than Kuhan ever imagined. The ripple effect was undeniable. Starting with a single food truck and one troubled youth, Masala Wheels evolved into a thriving movement, offering not just jobs, but also hope and a renewed sense of purpose to those in need. \"We started seeing more and more parents sending their at-risk children to help out at the truck,\" the 35-year-old recalls, adding: \"That truck literally became a vehicle for change.\" Realising the potential to create a broader impact, Kuhan and his friends established Pepper Labs, a social enterprise dedicated to driving social change through sustainable economic empowerment and inclusive growth. Masala Wheels became their flagship project, setting the tone for what would become a beacon of transformation for communities in need.   Their efforts didn't go unnoticed. In 2016, Masala Wheels received a nod of approval from none other than former United States president Barack Obama, who recognised their mission to uplift school dropouts and youths involved in gangsterism, paving the way for better livelihoods and second chances. Since its humble beginnings in 2015, the initiative has grown into a thriving movement. By 2017, it expanded to include an outlet in Petaling Jaya, offering Indian and Sri Lankan food through trucks, a cafe, catering services and even its own product line \u2014 all aimed at empowering disadvantaged youths. To date, it has impacted over 350 beneficiaries, providing not just jobs, but also a pathway to a brighter future. \"For many at-risk youths, it became a halfway home,\" Kuhan shares. Despite the challenges they faced while navigating their way out of difficult circumstances, it became a space for true transformation. Adds Kuhan with a smile: \"The best part? The troubled youth who was first entrusted with Masala Wheels is now the proud owner of the business in Petaling Jaya and he's running it successfully to this day.\" CLOUD KITCHENS   The success of Masala Wheels and the transformative impact it had on at-risk youths prompted Kuhan and his team at Pepper Labs to take a step back and examine the bigger picture. Where was this problem truly rooted? \"The answer,\" Kuhan explains, \"lay in the families and households these youths came from. The economic struggles of their families were creating the conditions that put these young people at risk.\" This realisation shifted their focus from addressing the symptoms to tackling the root cause, sparking a broader mission to break the cycle of poverty and provide long-term solutions for struggling communities. From 2021 onwards, Pepper Labs expanded its efforts into People's Housing Programme Project (PPR) areas, reaching some of the most underserved communities in the country. \"We realised that in many PPR communities, it's the women who hold the key to driving change,\" Kuhan reflects, adding: \"So, we began with home-based kitchen projects to help them launch small food businesses from their own kitchens.\" These projects soon transitioned into community kitchens and evolved into Dapur Digital, an innovative cloud-kitchen programme. Designed to empower B40 women micro-entrepreneurs, it provides culinary training, business management skills and digital marketing expertise \u2014 equipping them to thrive in the online food economy while uplifting their households and communities. In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance Ministry, the Federal Territories Ministry, Kuala Lumpur City Hall and Yayasan Hasanah, Pepper Labs established five cloud kitchens this year. These facilities serve as a lifeline for marginalised women entrepreneurs, offering hands-on training and the tools they need to build sustainable livelihoods while fostering economic empowerment at the grassroots level.   This year, the initiative reached a significant milestone, achieving a cumulative revenue of RM100,000 across all five kitchens. \"One hundred per cent of the profits went directly to these women entrepreneurs,\" Kuhan shares proudly. Buoyed by the success, the 2025 Budget included the announcement of plans to establish 20 more cloud kitchens in underserved communities across the country. This expansion aims to replicate the impactful model, empowering even more women entrepreneurs and fostering sustainable economic growth in areas that need it the most. The work continues relentlessly, and Kuhan has no intention of slowing down. \"We've always drawn inspiration from the changes we see in people. As long as lives are improving and people are leading better futures, that's what keeps us\u2026 keeps me going.\" One of the most touching moments for him happened recently while having breakfast in Brickfields. A young girl came running toward him, beaming with joy and shouting, \"Annei! Annei!\" She was one of the youths who'd been supported through Masala Wheels. \"She told me she'd just gotten a job and had bought her first car for her family,\" Kuhan recalls, voice filled with pride, adding: \"It's tiring, but moments like this can be so rewarding. They remember you because you've truly changed their lives.\" What started as a solitary quest for meaning in the shadow of the Himalayas has blossomed into a life devoted to empowering others. The vastness of the landscape that once made him feel insignificant now mirrors the vastness of the impact he's creating. \"I may just be a drop in the ocean,\" he concludes, adding: \"but even a drop can create ripples that change the world.\" elena@nst.com.my",

        "title": "'Define clearly to prevent RM500,000 homes labelled as affordable'",
        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: There must be a cleardefinition of \"affordable housing\" to prevent developers from labelling houses priced at RM500,000 as affordable, according to the National House Buyers Association (HBA). Datuk Chang Kim Loong, HBA's honorary secretary general, expressed optimism about affordable housing and rising homeownership numbers in Malaysia. However, he said that affordable housing must genuinely meet the needs of households with incomes at or below the median, as determined by a government-recognised housing affordability index. \"A home is more than a physical asset. It's a source of financial security in retirement. Every citizen aspires to have a roof over their head, and HBA urges the government to prioritise the people's interests over those of housing developers,\" said Chang. HBA defines affordable housing according to three key criteria. First, affordability means properties should be priced between RM150,000 and RM300,000, distinct from \"social housing units\" such as low and medium-cost housing priced below RM100,000, like People's Housing Projects (PPR), he told Business Times. Secondly, affordable housing should be suitable for family living, with a minimum built-up area of 800 sq ft (excluding balconies) and at least two bedrooms. Lastly, affordable housing should be in accessible areas with robust public transport links like LRT, MRT, and KTM and close to public amenities, including government schools, hospitals and hypermarkets. Chang said the government's proposals in the 2025 Budget for the housing sector are well-considered and, if implemented correctly, could significantly increase the supply of affordable homes, addressing the risk of a \"homeless generation.\" \"The past four years have been challenging, with Covid-19, floods, water pollution, changes in government leadership, inflation, rising food and utility costs, a shortage of well-paying jobs, and rising unemployment. These factors have dampened the hopes of many who are striving to overcome these hurdles,\" he added. HBA has been advocating for the establishment of a Housing Index, noting that \"different states and localities have varying standards or definitions of affordable housing.\" Such an index could help developers better align their pricing with buyers' affordability in less-developed areas, addressing the current mismatch between what buyers can afford and developers' selling prices. This disparity has led to a significant overhang of completed properties, as past statistics have shown. Establishing a national housing trust Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association (Rehda) president Datuk Ho Hon Sang recently proposed establishing a national affordable housing trust to ensure that affordable homes are built in areas with genuine demand. Ho said while developers are committed to affordable housing, they often face a mismatch between supply and demand. Data from the National Property Information Centre revealed that in the first quarter of 2024, 28.6 per cent of completed but unsold residential properties in Malaysia were priced below RM300,000. \"(The figure) highlights the mismatch of unsold affordable housing units. The focus should be on the right location, as some areas require more affordable housing units, while others require less due to the weak demand in those areas. \"There should be a more targeted solution rather than a one-shoe-fits-all approach to identifying the needs,\" Ho said. Ho suggested that the trust's committee should include representatives from the Housing and Local Government Ministry, state authorities and Rehda, with developers contributing a portion of their gross development value. The committee could then evaluate demand regionally, ensuring affordable housing is built strategically rather than following a non-market-driven quota that risks underserving or oversupplying areas. Rehda also encouraged industry players to enhance affordability by offering subsidised loans for affordable housing through banks. \"Other incentives, such as discounts on premium charges, development charges, and Improvement Service Funds, will go a long way in making housing more affordable for the people,\" he said. He expressed Rehda's support for the Madani housing concept and government initiatives aimed at expanding housing access, especially for the B40 and M40 groups. In August, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim directed the Federal Territories Department and Kuala Lumpur City Hall to integrate Madani housing blocks into all new residential projects, underscoring this as a condition for development approval to increase homeownership among low-income groups. Affordable housing should vary by state Samuel Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Olive Tree Property Consultants, said the definition of \"affordable housing\" should vary by state given each state's unique characteristics. \"For instance, a home priced at RM500,000 may be considered affordable in the Klang Valley but would be deemed luxurious in states like Kelantan or Perlis. It's essential for each state to define affordable housing based on local demographics,\" he told Business Times. Tan asserted that price alone shouldn't determine affordability. \"I fully agree price should not be the only parameter for defining affordable housing. As this is a social matter, the well-being of the occupiers must be prioritised. \"Hence quantifiable criteria like the number of bedrooms and baths, floor area, and finishes must be spelt out clearly so that the people have a habitable space to live.\" He also highlighted the importance of location, stressing that affordable housing should be situated in areas well-connected by public transportation and near essential amenities to meet residents' basic needs. Housing woes - PPR or PRR? Chang urged the government to reconsider the implementation of the Program Residensi Rakyat (PRR), a new public housing initiative by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In the 2025 Budget, the government allocated nearly RM900 million to fund 48 PRR projects, aiming to complete 30 by the end of 2025 and accommodate roughly 17,500 residents, alongside 14 Rumah Mesra Rakyat projects. \"Now, it seems we have a new terminology in PRR, or People's Residential Programme and a huge sum has been allocated for this new programme. \"We don't have details of this PRR scheme, but we have voiced our utmost concern about the idea of PRR (Project Perumahan Rakyat), which was earlier this year announced by the Housing and Local Government Minister,\" he said. Chang explained that the current social housing model, PPR, provides temporary accommodations for those working toward buying their own homes and should be rented out by designated agencies. \"The purpose is to offer interim housing to help people save toward homeownership. Those renting PPR flats should see them as temporary shelter for their families while they seek permanent homes.\" While he acknowledged the noble intent behind the PRR, Chang suggested improvements to prevent financial strain on the government and ensure sustainable support for future low-income generations. He noted that the construction cost per PRR unit is RM300,000, yet they are sold at RM60,000, with RM10,000 to RM15,000 of this set aside for maintenance and sinking funds. A 10-year moratorium on selling these units will also apply. \"HBA appreciates KPKT's efforts to expand social housing through PRR, but selling units at a heavy discount could harm future homeowners and the government,\" Chang said. He pointed out key concerns such as a RM240,000 loss per unit, the potential for profiteering, inadequate maintenance practices, and the risk of benefiting one generation at the expense of the next. \"HBA can understand why the Madani government is taking such an initiative, as property prices have risen too rapidly in recent years. \"As noted in Bank Negara Malaysia's 2016 annual report, the increase in house prices in Malaysia since 2012 has outpaced the rise in income levels. Consequently, prevailing median house prices are beyond the reach of most Malaysians.\" Tan, meanwhile, praised Johor's Rumah Iskandar initiative. \"This is a good model where the qualified people can rent from the state at a subsidised rental and with an option to buy later,\" he said.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: The government's desire to create a livable and humane People's Housing Programme (PPR) can be achieved through home purchase tax incentives and provisions for maintenance and upgrading projects as announced under the 2025 Budget. Universiti Putra Malaysia's Faculty of Design & Architecture senior lecturer Assoc Prof Dr Mohd Zairul Mohd Noor said the announcement reflected the government's commitment to continue mobilising efforts to improve the quality of life of the residents in government housing projects. \"The RM200 million allocation to replace dilapidated lifts in low-cost and medium-cost strata public housing is the right step because, currently, many PPR buildings faced maintenance issues which can threaten the safety and comfort of the residents. \"With the guarantee of continuous maintenance, especially for dilapidated lifts, it will increase the safety and comfort levels of the residents, who previously faced this problem frequently,\" he told Bernama. He said many studies reported that existing PPRs no longer met the needs of the residents because the buildings were decades old and the situation became a big challenge for the government in providing comfortable and safe housing for them. Mohd Zairul said that to ensure the facilities and infrastructure at the PPRs remain properly maintained, residents should be made aware of the importance of taking care of public property, thus preventing vandalism. \"As such, the proposal made by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) to impose stricter penalties on residents who neglect to pay maintenance fees to the Joint Management Body (JMB) is appropriate. \"This will ensure that maintenance fees can be collected consistently and enable infrastructure maintenance at all PPRs to be carried out more effectively, continuously and comprehensively,\" he said. Meanwhile, the provision of individual tax relief of up to RM7,000 on mortgage interest payments for those purchasing their first home could help Malaysians realise their dream of owning their own property. Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment lecturer Nasrudin Sharkawi said that through this initiative, the cost of buying a house priced below RM500,000 can be indirectly reduced. \"I look at it as being able to improve the ability, especially the young people who have just started working and the middle class, to purchase a house. Without these announced incentives, it would be somewhat difficult for this group to buy a house and that's why they'd rather rent a house,\" he said. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when tabling the budget recently, said the government planned to give individual tax relief of up to RM7,000 on mortgage interest payments for residential houses valued up to RM500,000. Tax relief of up to RM5,000, meanwhile, will be provided for residential houses priced above RM500,000 to RM750,000 and this relief can be claimed for three consecutive years of assessment on sale and purchase agreements completed between Jan 1, 2025 and Dec 31, 2027. Meanwhile, architect Mohd Azli Mohamad Jamil said the government's efforts to upgrade 48 MADANI public parks, including recreational areas and landscapes, with an allocation of almost RM100 million could create a community that is harmonious and has good social interaction. He said the government's focus on Kampung Baru Cina and Indian community villages would also meet the social needs of the communities indirectly. \"Recreational areas with beautiful landscapes provide opportunities for everyone to enjoy various physical activities, which can help promote an active lifestyle. Access to green spaces can also lead to a reduction in health-related problems. \"Studies have shown that spending time in green spaces or natural environments can reduce stress as well as improve one's mood and cognitive functions,\" he said.",
